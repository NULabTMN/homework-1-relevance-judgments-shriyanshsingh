          Mal > a. In the Arena for Mttv.
          Since the acquisition of Alaska in 1867
          public attention In regard to it has boon
          mainly directed to the salmon fisheries
          in Its waters and to the seal rookeries in
          Bohring sea. The value of the country
          as a dependency has boon wholly deter
          mined by the public from the rental
          which the PrlbOlolT Islands yield to the
          national treasury. Few references in the
          intor\-oning period have boon made by
          public journals and in the periodical
          literature of the country to the gold-
          yielding capabilities of Alaska , or' to the
          degree of development already reached.
          The truth Is that hundreds of thousands
          of intelligent Americans are profoundly
          ignorant of the fact that some of the
          largest and most profitable gold mining
          ontorpribcs within the limits of the
          United States are conducted in Alaska.
          Gold in variable quantities and under
          different conditions has been found in
          three principal districts of Alaska the
          Juneau and Douglass Island dibtrict , ISO
          iriilos northeast of Sltka nnd bordering
          Gastcncaux channel , a narrow inlet
          which separates Douglass island from
          the mainland ; the Sltka dibtrict , the
          quarU deposits of which nro found at
          Silver Iwy , n narrow , tortuous arm of
          the Pacific , indenting BaranolT island ,
          nnd in the valley of the Yukon river In
          western Alaska. Gold bearing quart/
          has albo been found nt Unga island , ono
          of the smaller of the Aleutian group , and
          SQIUO egort has been made there at de
          velopment , but moro of that hereafter.
          -mT" At * concerns the Yukon valley , little at
          tention 1ms boon paid by explorers nnd
          prospectors to discover gold bearing
          quartniul the only results , bp far , re
          late to placer mining. At the head of
          Lynn canal , ono of the inner pass
          ages adapted to steamer navigation ,
          about HIM ) miles northeast of Sltka. Is the
          ft * ' mouth of the Ohllcatl river , navigable
          for canoes for n score of miles. At the
          head of this canoe navigation nro three
          large t'hilcatl villages , and It is at this
          point where commences what is known
          ns the Chllcatl Portage , across the range
          to the head waters of the Yukon river in
          British territory. The distance from
          the Indian villages on the American
          side of the divide to the first lake , the
          bource of the Yukon , is about thirty
          miles , but the source is one of the most
          dillicult in the territory , yet the only
          practicable ono to reach the Yukon
          valley from the south. During the past
          three yeatt > the reports that the bars of
          the Yukon and its tributaries. Stewart
          and i'ellv rivers , nnd Forty-Mile crook
          were rich in placer gold , have induced
          several Alaska miners to venture across
          the range , at the Chllcatl crobsing and
          descend these streams. Several parties
          nro all known to have perished in this
          perilous search for the new gold fields.
          In the history of gold mining in the
          states and territories , no obstacle was so
          stubborn that it was not finally over
          come. . This , too , will be the history oj
          he tfolu" fields of western Alaska. Army officers who have served in the territory
          at various times , are now endeavoring to
          induce congress to authorize an explora
          tion of the Yukon Valley from its bourco
          to its mouth , and express a willingness
          to undergo the evident hardships and
          privations of such tin undertaking. The
          reports of the fertility of certain largo
          portions of that great valley , and re
          specting its agricultural possibilities ,
          are so conflicting and uncertain , that it
          can * hardly bo regarded as an absolute
          waste of money to authorize an
          intelligent olllcial examination of
          those valleys to that end.
          The permanent development of gold
          mining in Alaska has been made in the
          southeastern part of the territory , which
          embraces all that strip of mainland ,
          thirty miles wide from Portland chan
          nel at the southern boundary to the
          vicinity of Mt. St. Ellas , and Including
          the islands of the Alexandrian Archipe
          lago , which hug the mainland closely
          from south to north and west. The
          topography of this section is character
          istic and roijiarkablo. The thirty-mile
          strip of mainland belonging to the
          Uuited States is no more than an un
          broken range of very steep and lofty
          mountains , the summits of many of
          which nro" never free from snow.
          No valleys separate or break the con
          tinuity of thebo ranges. At intervals ,
          short , swift streams , fed by the interior
          glaciers , have worn down waterways
          to the bays and inlets , but these streams ,
          In most instances , are only wild cascades.
          Rarely ono finds the gorge , the stronin-
          bcd , wider than a space sufllciont for the
          passage of the water ; and in attempting
          to ascend to their sources , ono is con
          fronted by fierce torrents impossible to
          stem , and with no margin by their sides ,
          along which to pass around the catar
          acts. Frequently th'o last leap is made
          only a few rods from the point where the
          river enters the sea , and this is oven the
          rule. All the islands oil the coast
          of southern Alaska , UnrnnolT ,
          Admiralty , Douglass and Prince of
          Wales are simply mountains rising out
          of the Pacific , whoso interiors are vast
          glacial formations , whllo their fronts to
          the sea are clothed with timber. No
          white imm has over been heard W hav
          ing crossed either of thcbO islands , and
          the Indians disclaim over having
          attempted It , preferring the easier mode
          of passing around them in their canoes.
          The faces of the mountains toward the
          water , on the mainland and on the is
          lands of southeastern Alaska , nro very
          stoop , almost perpendicular , and covered
          with n deep , spongy bog or tundra ,
          which la always wet or moist. They are
          also covered with forests of fir , bpruco ,
          hemlock , yellow cedar , and u scrub birch
          and alder , up to the snow-lino , and this
          undergrowth of birch , salmon berry ,
          alder and devil's club makes everywhere
          almost Impassible thickets and jungles.
          These topographical conditions must bo
          borne In mind constant ! } ' , in considering
          the mining development and possibili
          ties of Alaska , for they llguro
          largely in estimating the present
          progress of the Industry.
          Gold quart ? was first dibcovorcd in the
          territory In 1877 , near Stiver Bay , In the
          vicinity of Sltka. The discoverer , Mr.
          Haley , was a boldier discharged from the
          regular army , and previous to his enlist
          ment , had mined in Colorado and Cali
          fornia. Numerous quartz lodes tire lo
          cated In the vicinity of his discovery ,
          which is nlmut three miles back from the
          beach , and far up the side of the moun
          tain. Haley opened several tunnels and
          exposed valuable quartz , and succeeded
          In boiling two of his discoveries for fif
          teen thousand dollars.
          The proprietors of another lode some
          distance from the original discovery put
          up a live-stamp mill ; but for the want of
          adequate capital to place the enterprise
          on a square footing , conjoined with feeble
          and incompetent management , the pro-
          jcct went to pieces , the mill was sold by
          the mai-bhal and is now corroding to
          ruin in the rain and snow. Another
          company , organized under the laws of
          Wisconsin , have become the owners of
          the ' 'Lucky Chanoc , " and with a five-
          btiunp mill are making satisfactory
          milling tests , preparatory to a liberal
          and adequate investment "in a plant the
          coining year. Water for power in that
          group is abundant all the year round ,
          and owing to the mildness of the
          winters at Sitkn , through the trend of
          the Japan current , milling operations
          will seldom if over bo interrupted by
          freezing weather. Ore has been taken
          out of ledges in the Sltka group , yield
          ing $40 it ton ; but numerous tests made
          demonstrate that the fair average is
          about $10 a ton. All the work and ex
          ploration done up to this time , in this
          imsin , has been of the crudest , most careless -
          loss and unsatisfactory character. No
          definite policy of prospecting and exploration -
          ploration in any part of the territory has
          ever been adopted , and whore discover
          ies have bepn made they wore
          merely accidental. Those owning
          tind controlling these valuable interests
          have hitherto boon unable to inspire
          that confidence in the future of their
          properties which Is necessary to induce
          capital to even closely investigate their
          value and possibilities. The manner of
          developing this and other similar min
          ing localities in Nebraska will bo re
          ferred to again , when considering the
          larger and more thoroughly worked
          mining district of Juneau and Douglass
          Ibland. It is to the latter that wo must
          lool : for the most satisfactory results ,
          and by noting what has already been ac
          complished in that field , poisibly predict
          whether the gold yield of Alaska will bo
          permanent and profitable , or only litful
          and spasmodic.
          .Tuneau and Douglass Island nro 180
          miles northeast of Sitkn , and reached
          from the hitter place by the inner pns-
          songcs of Peril and Catham straits , and
          Gnstcnoaux channel , which separates
          Douglnbs island from the mainland. In
          1880 , that bection of southern Alaska
          was without a single whlto inhabitant ,
          and was ono of the most forbidding portions
          tions oj the earth. In October of that
          year Mr. N. A. Fuller , in charge of the
          affairs of the Northwest trading com
          pany at , Sitka , became aware of the fact
          that Auk and Tarku Indians , whoso vil
          lages wore on the mainland at Gasto-
          ncaux channel , possessed a tradition of
          the oxistnnco of gold in some
          of the deep basin of the moun
          tains in that vlcinlty.Ono particular
          basin was designated as containing
          abundance of this treasure. Having
          faith in the story , Fuller fitted out a
          canoe expedition for the purpose of test
          ing his uoliof. It was Intrusted to a
          Canadian French miner , Jo oph Juneau ,
          the nophawof the founder of Milwaukee ,
          and who had visited all the gold mines
          from Arizona and Old Mexico in the
          bouth , to Cnssiur , in British Columbia , In
          the north. Junenn was accompanied by
          two Sitknn Indians as guides , and
          after ten days of a tempestuous canoe
          voyage up Chatham Straits , landed near
          the site of the present town now bearing
          his name , and proceeded to follow the
          dillicult course of Gold crook , the outlet
          to SilverJ3o\v basin , until he reached
          the head of a gulch filled with glacier
          ice. Passing down the gulch , Juneau
          dibcovorcd some quartz laid bare and
          protruding into the ravine , and nn ex
          amination showed at once that-it was
          rich in gold , so rich that the free gold
          was apparent in many places
          whore the rock was fractured.
          Claims were staked oil , the party
          returned to Sitkn , and reported their
          success to Mr. Fuller. The secret could
          not bo long kept. Before spring had
          fairly opened several hundred miners
          were on the ground , and the nucleus of a
          prosperous mining camp created.
          When the snow disappeared from the
          basin , with its area of a thousand acres
          or more , with mountain walls for its
          .steep sides , it was found that centuries
          of erosion had created in that contracted
          area ono of the richest placer mines
          over worked. Though of limited area it
          equalled in richness many of the old Cal
          ifornia plaeerH.
          ONo civ 11 government was formed in
          Alaska until more than three years
          afterward , but in the spring of 1881 the
          2oO hardy old minors who had explored
          nearly every region where gold had
          hitherto been found , mot and adopted a
          code of mining laws which became obligatory -
          gatory upon every miner in the district.
          Half a do/on beautiful glacial streams
          poured from the sides of the mountains ,
          hemming in Silver Bow basin and feed
          ing the rapid torrent of Gold crook , fur
          nished abundance of water for gold wash
          ing , and before that summer ended fully
          $1,000 in gold dust had been taken out ,
          and still only a meagre impression
          made , Quito $1,000,000 in dubt have
          been washed out of the sand and
          dirt of that ono basin in the intervening
          years , and the surface is now practically
          worked out. Pay gravel exists , how
          ever , to a considerable depth on the fioor
          of the basin , and a now company has run
          a tunnel through ono of the environing
          ridges , for the purpose of mining by the
          hydraulic process. Two stamp mills are
          also in operation upon quarton the
          Mime ground , and a roadway , two and a
          half miles long , and costing $1,000 ! ! ,
          has been completed , so as to connect the
          mines with the channel beach. A flourish
          ing town of 1,500 white inhabitants has
          grown up about this mining location ,
          with schools , churches and many of the
          comforts of civilization.
          The development of quart/ mining on
          that portion of the mainland of south
          eastern Alaska has just fairly qom-
          menccd. Every indication points to the
          Inexhaustible character of the gold
          quartz deposits , and though there is
          nothing of a high grade , or of fabulous
          richness , yet it is manifest that mining
          carried on bore with adequate capital ,
          ample plants and conservative methods
          insures that this section of Alaska will
          have tin indefinite period of prosperity
          as a mining district. Farther on I shall
          speak of what is requisite in order to
          make the handling of these low grade
          ores of Alaska remunerative.
          About three miles } to the eastward of
          the town , and UP Iho gulch of Snoop's
          Creek , recent discoveries of quartz have
          nlf > o been made , equalling those in Sivor
          How Basin. No mills have been yet
          erected to work thifcb deposits of gold-
          bearing rock , bulv considerable quanti
          ties have been shipped to Seattle and
          Portland , and refilled with fair profits to
          the owners of thtsJmlnos. Though ex
          plorations have been frequently made to
          discover silver in the territory , none was
          found until the winter of 1888 , when a
          fine rich voln of galena was dibcovorcd
          in the Sheep's Creole gulch already
          alluded to. It 5 * reported by credi
          ble persons as hijylng yielded jlUO per
          ton In the mnoUe al Portland.
          Soon after the gold discoveries on the
          mainland at Juneau , prospectors crosbcd
          over to Douglas Island , only two miles
          distant. Hero was found abundance of
          placer gold , on the face of the mountain
          which rises directly out of the water at
          nearly all points along the shore , but at
          this particular place recedes from the
          beach , leaving a stretch of low land moro
          than a mile long and a few hundred foot
          wldo. Whllo some were engaged in
          washing the dirt , others began to
          search for quartz lodes In the same vi
          cinity , and on. the face of the same
          mountain. The Indications were fair ,
          but putting in the necessary tunnels for
          exploration was expensive , and those
          engaged soon became discouraged. John
          Troadwoll , who had boon n successful
          contractor and builder in San Francisco ,
          was attracted to Alaska "by exaggerated
          tales of fabulous bonanzas , and touching
          nf Douglas Island , found the owners
          to several quarts claims ready
          to abandon their rights , fully dis
          heartened. Troadwoll purchased their
          interests and improvements for a small
          amount , and with faith , energy and re-
          bources pushed the explorations already
          begun to a conclusion.
          For many months ho was the butt of
          every old miner's ridicule in all that re
          gion. At last ho pierced a ledge of gold-
          bearing rock 400 feet wide , over 800 feet
          deep from the surface and moro than
          0,000 feet in length from east to west.
          ! This , in fact , became the great Trend-
          ' well gold mine , now operated by the
          Alaska Mining and Milling company.
          Ho was soon able to convince capitalists
          that ho had something in which it would
          pay to invest , and the company
          was orgnni/ed in 1881 , with Sen
          ator Jones of Nevada and D.
          C. Mills of Now York , the principal
          shareholders. A mill with 120 stamps
          was erected in a few months , and the
          mill and chlorination works on a grand
          scale put in operation. Two largo ditches ,
          ono ten miles long to the westward ,
          along the face of the mountain , and the
          other to the cast , five miles in length ,
          were constructed with great difficulty
          and expense , owing to the tundra character -
          actor of the surface , to convoy water to
          the mill as a motive power. A pressure
          of 700 feet , through iron pipes twenty
          inches in diameter , was communicated ,
          to a wheel of eight feet in diameter , by
          which all those ponderous stamps , 2,000
          pounds each , and the other ma
          chinery , were set in motion
          and did their work. For
          two years the mill and works were kept
          in constant operation , no ccsbntion night
          or day , during the week. Early in 1888 ,
          the capacity of the stamp mill was ex
          panded , and the number of stamps in
          creased to two hundred and forty , mak
          ing the largest mill of the Hind under
          ono roof In the world.
          The policy of keeping the establish
          ment in constant operation remains
          unchanged , and since its increase in
          capacity , there has boon n stoppage of
          only ono day. During the summer of
          18S'J , fifteen miles were added to the
          ditch for water supply , and to intercept
          additional streams as they came down
          the mountain side to the Boa. During
          the winters of 1887 and 1888 , there was
          no interruption of the supply of water
          by cold weather , for motive power , butte
          to guard against any contingency of that
          that kind , a powerful Corliss engine has
          boon provided to drive the great mans of
          machinery at such times. The winters
          at Douglass island are seldom bo severe
          that the rapid , fresh-water torrents
          freeze over and deprive the mill of its
          full supply. In December , 18b' ' , them
          was some dlfilculty in that respect , and
          the Corliss engine was doing tno work
          of the water-wheel.
          ThoTrcndwoll is not n mine In the
          strict fcnhO. The rock is taken out of
          an open quarry and convoyed to the mill
          less than live hundred feet distant on a
          trnmwnv. Its capacity Is ( WO tons every
          twenty-four hours. The profits of the
          establishment are , of course ,
          the company's own secret , but
          exports acquainted with this
          quart/ , and other conditions , put the
          average yield per ton at $10 and the cost
          of extracting the metal , at from $1 to
          $1.50 per ton. By the amalgam procofs ,
          all the free gold which passes from the
          stamps to the concentrators is recov
          ered , while the residue , in the form of
          sulphurets ; is manipulated by rousting
          ami chlorination in the vast wooden
          building which stands several hundred
          yards nearer the beach than the stamp
          mill.
          mill.This
          This company owns 0,000 lineal foot ,
          or six quart/ claims in length , from east
          to west , and while in four years of con
          stant movement , an enormous cavity in
          the sideof the mountain has IK-OII
          created , the indications are that the
          supply of rook , at the present rate of
          production , will hold out for a quarter
          of a century yot. A line electric light
          plant enables the operatives to work by
          night in the mill , and in the chlorina
          tion works and the mine. Four
          hundred men arc employed in va
          rious duties about the mine ,
          stamp mill , chlorination work , stores ,
          and saw and planing mills , which the
          companv operates as part of its mining
          and mining plant. About one-third of
          the operatives are Indians or natives of
          Alaska. The latter are an industrious ,
          frugal and reliable class of mining em
          ployes , and receive the same wages as
          white men engaged in the same olu-s of
          work. Indians are largely employed not
          only at the salmon canneries in south
          eastern Alaska as fibhcrmen , but in
          nearly all the mining operations of that
          bection of the territory. No antagonism
          exists between them and white labor ,
          and their relations are of the most
          cordial character. The white minors
          in southeastern Alaska do otn
          permit Chinamen to engage in that
          class of work , and coolies are
          only found on the inside , all the salmon
          canneries , always going below at the end
          of the season.
          Early last year work was begun on the
          "Bear's Nest , " a mining claim which
          was sold to an English syndicate in the
          fall of 1888 for $2,000,000. It is located
          about half a milo west of the Treadwel ,
          and was sold on the strength of its good
          neighborhood , and upon the results of
          diamond drill tests. After a tunnel had
          penetrated the hillside for 1,000 feet ,
          and about $70,000 had been expended
          toward erecting a stamp mill , and other
          parts of the requisite plant , they failed
          to strike tholedgo which was doomed to
          bo a westward prolongation of the rich
          and extensive lode contsituting the
          Trendwell. Operations have boon sus
          pended , and litigation to determine
          whether the sale was a fraudulent trans
          action , the salting of a mine , or whuthoi
          the failure to roach a paying ledge was
          '
          the result of operative 'blundering has
          been begun. The mere fact that an en
          terprise starting out with so much of
          promlbo failed in the very midst of the
          brightest anticipations , will , most cer
          tainly , produce a ohilling olToct upon all
          present attempts to inaugurate now
          mining enterprises in Alaska. The
          Mexican company , a corporation with
          abundant resources , however , Is vigor
          ously probcctiting Its explorations at an
          equal distance to the eastward of the
          Treadwell , in the hope and confidence ,
          and with every prospect of intercepting
          the prolongation of the Treadwell ledgo.
          Rich deposits of gold-bearing quart/
          have also been discovered on Admiralty
          island , in the same group as Douglass
          island , and stamp mills are in course of
          erection there alhO.
          The discovery of coal near the beach ,
          and easy of access by water transporta
          tion nt Cook's inlet , Ungn island and at
          other nvilahlo points on the coast of
          western Alaska , will hnvq an important
          bearing not only on the general commer
          cial importance of the territory , but upon
          its gold and silver mining enterprises ,
          Coal , when used In the latter industry ,
          is now only attainable at Departure bay ,
          British Columbia , and with the enor
          mous cos * , of coal freights under the
          present nrrungoments of transportation
          the work of development Is more or less
          retarded.
          One word moro with respect to the
          future of gold mining In Alaska. AH far
          as discoveries extend ; the ores are of a
          low grade. This will requite that they
          bo handled In largo plants with capital
          in largo mass , owing to the policy pur
          sued by the company operating the
          Treadmill mine. In addition to that ,
          the management must bo of an Intelli
          gent character and not mere Inexpert
          experiments by unskillful adventurers.
          Under such conditions Alaska , through
          its gold mines , will be n source of great
          wealth to the entire country.

        <text>ALASKA HAS BIG PRIZES
          FOR THE WINNERS.
          THE eyes of the gold hunters
          of the world are on Alaska.
          With the coming year will
          begin one of the greatest
          gold rushes in the history of
          the world. It is safe to say
          that fully 100,000 adventurers
          will strain and struggle to
          be first in the mad race for the new El
          Dorado. Is there a chance for all?
          Will not hundreds perish in the race?
          Readers of those fascinating stories
          of glittering finds made on the Klon
          dike must not think for a moment that
          any one can go there and pick up gold.
          Far from it. The poor man who
          reaches there with a dollar in his
          pocket may, in the wild juggle of
          things, strike on everlasting fortune,
          but his chances are Infinitely smaller
          than those of the capitalist who goes
          there with sufficient means to permit
          him to carefully comb over the pros
          pects and select the offers of those com
          pelled by necessity to sacrifice their
          claims. The men who have made the
          big strikes to date went into the' coun-
          I try well supplied to battle with adverse
          I fortiine and bad weather. Had they
          j struck nothing they could have tided selves within her lines. Robinson Cru
          soe cut more of a figure on his lonely
          island than do the 400 miners now
          scratching the frozen ground along a
          few iceclad streams. Of all this vast
          expanse practically nothing is known.
          For instance, take Baranoff Island,
          where Sitka, the capital, is situated.
          It is eighty miles long by forty broad,
          and has been settled for over 100 years.
          Yet no one has ever penetrated the
          mountains of the interior.
          Since Vitus Bering discovered the
          country in 1741, while cruising for the
          Russian Government, it has lain al
          most as quiet, unnoticed and undis
          turbed by hustling white men as the
          j interior of China. As usual in the de
          velopment of new lands commerce
          hunters first opened it up. But out
          side of furs and fish they discovered
          nothing for 150 years. But plain furs
          proved a giant bonanza for that big
          ■'•monopoly, the Russian-American Fur
          Company. On one cargo of 80,000 sea
          otter skins alone they received $40 per
          pelt. Those were the days when the
          nobles of the Orient paid fancy prices
          for rare and fine furs. Governor Bar
          anoff was the brains of the business.

          dike. First, gold was found on Stew
          art river, a tributary of the Yukon,
          and prospectors began to drift into that
          region. New mines were discovered
          slowly. What was then considered rich
          diggings came to light, and Alaska
          quietly and unostentatiously drifted
          toward competency and civilization.
          Last spring came the news of gold
          discoveries that set the world agog.
          And now expeditions are being form
          ed in all parts of the world to venture
          into this almost unknown region. So
          much for the past development of the
          country.
          Alaska Is entering upon an era of
          tremendous development and prosper
          ity in comparison with the past. These
          new conditions demand new regula
          tions and new laws for her government.
          Many new propositions will be present
          ed to the coming Congress and many
          of them will be wild and impracticable.
          The best and safest proposition fox
          the people of Alaska is to have Con
          gress pass an act allowing the President
          to appoint a commission of persons
          who have resided in Alaska and who
          are well acquainted with its needs and
          conditions, to draft a code of laws,
          both civil and criminal, and also to
          make such changes in the organic act
          and to establish such courts as may
          be necessary.
          From among the hardy, resourceful
          men who sprinkle gold rushes there
          will spring to the front brainy ones
          plenty capable of handling all local
          questions till the Government steps
          in. Alaska is in need of such people.
          They hustle around and force things
          into line. Alaska has hibernated so
          long that next spring's awakening
          will be something tremendous for her.
          The Indians have a saying: "White
          man heap fool; take gun and go out
          hunt bear. Indian take gun and go
          out and wait for bear." In a rough
          fashion that has been the character
          of the country to date. Those Indians
          are a queer lot to enterprising white
          men. I remember a mine on Kotzebue
          Sound; it is a very rich silver mine
          and the farthest north in this country,
          where the manager went to San
          Francisco for the long winter, leaving
          several natives to watch the plant and
          the six tunnel mules till spring. When
          Green got back In July he asked the
          boss native what kind of a winter
          they had had. "Oh, fine; heap fine,"
          was the reply. "Heap plenty to eat.
          Everything heap plenty and fat."
          They had eaten the six mules. •
          Alaska is probably the most Inacces
          sible country on
          the globe. To pros
          pect the gold fields
          requires not only
          moral courage, but
          a great deal of
          physical strength
          and endurance. All
          its approaches are
          by water. Even
          the big part of the
          .summer traveling
          must be done by
          water, for there is
          not ten miles of
          Ie country on
          globe. To pros
          : the gold fields
          aires not only
          al courage, but
          rreat deal of
          sical strength
          endurance. All
          approaches are
          water. Even
          big part of the
          imer traveling
          »t be done by
          er, for there is
          ten miles of
          tlway in all of
          the 600,000 square
          miles of territory,
          Even the trails
          are wretched apol
          ogies for footwear.
          More cattle paths
          and rough roads
          were constructed
          last spring by the
          pioneer gold rush
          ers than were built
          by the pelt-hunt
          ers and fishers dur
          ing the preceding
          150 years.
          The coast waters
          that the gold hunt
          ers will be -obliged
          to voyage are fre
          quently visited by
          sudden storms.
          The vessels select
          ed for the trips
          should be of the
          most stanch and
          seaworthy kind
          and should be com
          manded by experi
          enced and compe
          tent navigators.
          I would sound a
          Word of warning
          in regard to those
          old hulks and river
          boats that are be
          ing fitted up for
          the Alaska trade.
          I am satisfied that
          many of them will
          not reach their
          destination. If you
          go by Dyea and
          the Chilcoot Pass
          you will have 25
          miles of land trav
          el over an eleva
          tion of 4000 feet
          high. If the trip is
          made in the early spring you must pass over on snow
          shoes and take the risk of being
          caught in the blizzards which dur
          ing that season visit the summits.
          To me it is a matter of regret that so
          many people are determined to try to
          get into this inhospitable country
          during the coming spring and summer.
          Thousands of them are going without
          proper preparation and a sufficient
          amount of means. There is no ques
          tion but that many of them will meet
          disappointment, suffering and death.
          It will take years to properly de
          velop the broad Alaskan gold fields.l
          I earnestly advise those who Jft^e
          planned to go and who have not ade- .
          quate means for a year's camp there
          to patiently wait until better and
          cheaper facilities for reaching the
          Yukon basin are supplied. Companies
          have been formed to build railroad^
          into the interior from different points
          on the coast. Several of these com
          panies will no doubt have a railway
          constructed within the coming year.
          There is no danger of the crop of
          mines becoming exhausted within the
          next twenty-five years. I came to the
          California mines in 1852. I left in 1854
          thinking the mines were worked out.
          I returned here forty-two years after
          ward and found that gold-mining in
          California was only in its infancy;
          more gold was produced this year than
          will be produced in all Alaska and
          British Columbia within the next two
          years.
          Once in the gold fields, what are the
          chances for the poor man and the rich
          man?
          Briefly, then, without a proper outfit
          and supplies, it is absolutely hopeless
          for any one to tempt fortune by pros
          pecting. The seasons are so shot"t. liv
          ing so dear and traveling so difficult
          that to work for wages practically cuts
          a man ! off from aiming at anything
          higher. With from $500 to $1000 ,in his
          pocket,' however, a man may reason
          ably try his chances with the best of
          the prospectors. Consider some of the
          difficulties of mining there and you will
          see why this is so. As far as any one
          has dug down the ground is solidly
          frozen. One miner told me he had sunk
          a shaft forty-five feet and the ground
          was icebound ahead of him. Wood
          cannot be got for less than $20 a cord.
          The ground must be thawed with fire
          before It can be picked out. WJ*uere
          wages are $10 a day it costs about §_ J 0 __\
          a foot to sink a hole. The poor 1 W*\\\m\\
          can calculate how long he can hold P*-
          to sink a shaft on his prospect a* ditch
          figures. But capital is going into the
          country No doubt it . will give em
          ployment to a large number of poor
          men, both in working the older mines
          I and in prospecting for new ones.
          The gold field is very extensive. I be
          lieve that good mires will be discov
          ered north of the Yukon, and that b*-^*
          fore many years ships will be trans- 1
          porting miners and supplies through:,
          Bering Strait into the Arctic Ocean
          and landing them at the mouth of the
          Coquille River for the purpose of work
          ing the mines en that and other
          streams which flow into the northern
          ocean.
          Outside of .finding employment in the
          mines the poor man has practically no
          chance of earning a living. There is
          no country on earth where he can
          starve to death quicker. The cold
          temperature of almost eight months of
          the year makes it imperative that he
          'shall have a proper amount of food
          and good clothing. True, the rush of
          adventurers will develop lines of busi
          ness that must furnish supplies to the
          mines, but a limited number of men
          will fill all such billets. The fish and
          fur trades already have all the men
          they can handle. The lumber business,
          cuts but a small figure on acccount of
          the scarcity of good timber. Agricul
          ture and grazing will always be very
          limited. Supplies will always have to
          come from abroad, and only wealthy/
          companies will be able to handle thejw j
          in the present rough and expensive |
          conditions of transportation. '*
          One point these gold-rushers should I
          bear In mind: In prospecting the prac
          tical miner has very little or no advan
          tage over the novice. In that country"
          no person can figure on surface indi
          cations while prospecting. Many of ;
          the big finds of this last year were in
          what you might call marshes. No
          practical miner would have dreamed 1
          of looking in such places for gold indi
          cations. There is an old saying: "Silver,
          lies in veins and gold is where you*^
          it." Six thousand years of experience-'
          has proved the truth of this saying.
          The chief \ advantage the practical
          miner will have over the novice will be
          in working and developing claims. : . J

          ST. MICHAELS, Alaska, Sopt. 15.—
          The most remarkable gold mining at
          present In the world, if not in the entire
          history of gold mining, is that now in
          progress at and about Cape Nome, on
          Norton Sound, Behring Sea, Alaska, sit
          uated about 225 miles north and west
          of the mouth of the Yukon river, or 135
          miles from this point. Gold was first dis
          covered on Snake river last fail, and
          during the earlier portion of this season.
          Cape Nome district had acquired con
          siderable repute as a gold producer, and

          / country, many of them stranded here,
          f went over to Nome and either staked
          such claims as they could get, or secured
          work as they could find It. Much com
          plaint was made that claims had been
          taken by persons holding powers of at
          torney, their principals not being present
          in person, and in June the Cape Nome
          district had become so unpopular 'hat
          reports were circulating to the effect that
          the whole thing was a "fake" foisted on
          the public by the transportation compa
          nies to Improve their business.
          Whatever of truth there may have been
          In these stories Is now of small import,
          for in June or early July, some one of
          the stranded miners tenting on the beach,
          as the only unclaimed space, accidentally
          discovered gold in the sand at his feet.
          He told his story quickly among his
          stranded friends, and soon all the unem
          ployed were at work on the beach with
          any and all kinds of tools that would
          dig. Their success was such that within
          a few days men who had work on
          claims along the creek at $10 a day and
          board threw up their jobs and took to
          the beach, expecting to earn, and actual
          ly earning in many instances, as much in
          an hour as they had earned in a day.
          Never had such easy mining brnn heard
          Df, never had it been found so unex
          pectedly and so opportunely, and it was
          •lot long before everything else was 2
          serted for the seashore, and even wo
          olen and boys of 10 or 12 years were to bo
          found as busy in the sand as the men
          were.
          Since the discovery the number of j
          "beach combers," as they are called, has I
          steadily increased, and today is presented
          the strange' sight of hundreds of miners I
          rof both sexes and all ages and condl- }
          ".ions strung out along the beach for a ;
          rlozen miles or more.
          For miles to the west of Cape Nome the [
          oeach runs straight away In a strip of
          ;lde land, varying from forty to sixty
          !eet in width between high and low water
          mark, extending up to the "tundra" cr
          black alluvial soil, which is from three
          to five feet higher than the beach proper.
          All of this tundra, ard all the territory
          along the creeks and rivers east and west j
          for thirty or forty miles and back into j
          the mountains for ten or twelve miles had !
          been staked, but on the long strip of tide i
          lands no man had a better claim than j
          another, or could have, under the tide- ;
          land laws, and here the grand army of
          gold seekers camped, and in very short ;
          order had converted the barren strand '■
          Into a site of tremendous and enthusiastic
          Industry. At the same time business of
          all kinds began to respond to the boom
          i from the beach, and the usual collection
          of gambling hells, saloons and dance
          halls went Into operation. At present it
          t ls estimated that 1,000 to 1,200 miners are
          at work on the beach, extending west for
          twenty miles. All these work with rock
          _ ers, and they occupy just as much ter
          ~ ritory to the man or group as can work
          It It is not unusual for one small square
          bit of beach to pan out $10 to $15 an hour,
          but, of course, the space is soon exhaust
          ed and the lucky digger must move to
          another snot.
          . This beach deposit of gold Is as yet
          an unsolved problem. By some It Is claim
          ed that the gold In the sand, which is
          entirely "dust," has been washed out
          from the tundra by the waves at high
          tide and deposited through hundreds of
          years in the sand. It is found here now
          from two to five feet below the surface In
          the drift, and so plentiful that the miner
          who does not find It In paying quantities
          is the exception. On the other hand,
          there are some who claim that the gold
          is washed in from the sea, and that the
          real field or "mother lode," so to speak.
          Is to be reached and developed by dredg
          ing. There may be something in this
          theory, but the other seems to be the
          more tenable, "-.ark'jpi^eya^fa^
          The beach to the east of Cape Nome
          makes no such gold showing as does the
          beach to the west, owing to the existence
          of a long reach of water or "lagoon,"
          which lies a short distance back from
          the sea and parallel with It. Gold deposits
          along the creeks the interior are quite
          as rich In one direction as the other.
          The headquarters of the Cape Nome
          territory is Anvil City—so named from
          the shape" of the mountain above It—at
          . the mouth of Snake river, although Nome
          City is the postofflce. While the city pos
          sesses a number of frame houses, tents
          are the prevailing shelter, and prices for
          commodities are pretty much as they are
          In all mining towns. Notwithstanding
          this is one of the most' accessible mining
          towns on earth, as ships from any part
          of the world may come up to its very
          doors, making due allowances for no har
          bor, and -much delay between ship '- and
          shore in bad weather. Meals are from
          •$1.50 to $2.50 each; a bed In a tent, $1.50;
          plain drinks, 50 cents each; beer, 50 cents
          per glass, and other things in proportion,
          including a mutton chop at $I.2s—and, by
          the way, these are not much in excess of
          prices at first-class places ln New York
          city. Copper plate for use In rockers is
          worth Its weight In silver, and one miner
          who had no copper substituted silver dol
          lars for It, sixty-four of them being re
          quired to properly plate his rocker, which,
          added to the first cost of $20, made it
          somewhat expensive, even for this local
          ity. Labor in the mines Is worth from $8
          to $10 a day and board, and even carpen
          ters, about the only other class of labor,
          are paid $1.50 and hour and board them
          selves. As the days In summer are from
          eighteen to twenty-four, hours long, a
          carpenter can put In a lot of spare time.
          Everybody has money, and as many who
          have It are not used to It, they are lav
          ishing their earnings by day on gambling,
          liquor and dance halls at night. Gam
          bling takes the bulk of the dust, and
          every species of game is represented in
          Anvil City.
          As to what amount of geld is being
          taken out, there Is no means of determin
          ing. It is known that not more than $200,
          --000 in all have been shipped by steamer,
          and $100,000 of that has gone out within
          the past week. The beach mining is re
          ported to be turning out about $30,000 a
          day, but this in the nature of things can
          not continue, and when it is exhausted
          these men will go to work on the numer
          ous claims lying back from the sea and
          along the creeks. Here the gold is found
          In very rich deposits, the claim of Linde
          burg- Co., on Anvil Creek, turning out
          over $1,000 an hour ($25,000 in twenty-four
          hours),. one nugget recently found being
          worth $312. Another claim, owned by Dr.
          Kettlesen, in one day cleared* up $9,000,
          and so the stories go. One may hear al
          most any kind of a fairy tale, and while
          some cf them are exaggerated the fact
          remains that just now every man in the
          district has a pocket full of dust and ?
          heart full of hope, and there are no dead
          brokes In- Anvil City. "What the condi
          tions will be a year hence will not be
          known until then, and cannot be pre
          dicted.
          Nov. 1 communication with - the outside
          world will be completely shut off for sev
          en month's at least, and only a few of
          (he people now in the Cape Nome district
          are fixed with either food or shelter for
          the sever!- of the climate, though those
          who are prepared with houses to live in
          and sufficient food and fuel can not only'
          pass the winter comfortably, but can do
          more or less work.
          There are very few so well eff as this,
          however, fuel being scarcer than food,
          but among the "beach combers" a novel
          plan will be adopted. Parties of four,
          six or eight will organize for winter op
          erations by securing a large tent, spread
          ing ii over the ground they propose to
          work In, and there they, will set up house
          keeping. The canvas will.be protected on
          the outside from the weather in every
          way possible, and stoves will be kept go
          ing on the inside, so that the tent will not
          only be comfortable to live and to work
          in, but it will never freeze in there, and
          the mining can go on quite as satisfac
          torily as if the balmy spring were the
          only season known in tho Cape Nome dis
          trict A groat rush is expected in the
          spring, but, as has been stated, there are
          no claims unstaked anywhere . within
          thirty or forty miles of Anvil City, and
          what lies beyond those limits is pracfical
          ly unknown. But, according to the tales
          of prospectors, as far beyond as Cape
          Prince of "Wales, 2:*5 miles, gold has been
          found along the creaks in quantities that
          would pay from $10 to $50 per man par
          day if panned by an expert.
          Claims are offered for sale—a claim be
          ing twenty acres—at prices from $50,000
          to $150,000, and there are, of course, at
          this time not many takers at those, fig
          ures, but they are expected In the spring
          with the rush.
          j -Over 1,000 claims—covering 20,000 acres,
          i about thirty square miles of territory
          j have been recorded, and It is generally
          j believed that each claim represents a
          | suit at law, so hasty and haphazard have
          j been the methods of procedure in secur
          ing claims.
          The claims of this entire section are of
          the placer variety, and so far no quartz
          has been discovered, which means that
          what is a busy mining camp with millions
          this year may be a deserted village twelve
          months later.
          Nome gold is much darker in color than
          the gold of the Yukon river country, as
          saying $19 an ounce, though the current
          trading price Is $18 an ounce. Gold dust
          and nuggets constitute the bulk of the
          currency, and gold scales are as neces
          sary in the stores as the ordinary gro
          cer's scales.- And gold dust as a circulat
          ing medium Is not as popular as it might
          be, for coin or paper money coihmandg
          a premium of 7 per cent In many local
          ities. Such money is known as "che'eha
          ko," or "nev/comber." as only the new
          arrivals have it, and that. Is the Eskimo
          word for new arrivals.
          Winter at Anvil City—that is to say, In
          the entire Nome ordinarily con
          tinues from October to June, and a tem
          perature of 50 lo CO degrees below is not
          unusual. On Dec. 21 the sun barely rises
          above the horizon, and on "June 21 it does
          not disappear entirely from sight during
          the twenty-four hours.
          To the prospective miner in ' the states"
          expecting to try his luck in the.:* Cape
          Nome rush next spring, or rather next
          season, it may ba said.. that he should
          keep his attention fixed on weather re
          ports from the Northwest and be in San
          Francisco, or Seattle. In June., to catch
          the first boat out. as Norton bay usually
          opens in June. What the faro wi'l be
          cannot be told this year, but now It la
          $G0 and $75, according to accommodations,
          to St. Michaels, and $20 on to Nome by
          the small steamers crossing the bay—
          miles. The distance direct to Nome from
          San Francisco Is about 2.800 miles, and
          from Seattle or Tacoma 2,300 miles, and
          competition has made the fare to St.*
          Michaels the same. What changes the
          rush of gold seekers next year will make
          remains to be seen. It Is merely an or
          dinary agreeable sea trip, and the miner
          arriving at Nome Is practically In the
          midst of his field of labor as soon as he

        <text>yTatiana, the
          ? ? Eldorado in Alaska.' Already thou?
          sands of frenzied seekers after gold are there.
          "For fortunes beyond the dreams of.ava
          , rice are being garnered by placer mines along
          the streams in that locality.
          As much as $ioo a pan has.been washed
          out in this new district. How startling these
          figures are to miners may be judged from'the
          fact that, ground averaging 40 cents to the
          pan is considered a bonanza, and ip cents a
          pan is regarded as big pay.
          During the last winter, in spite of the
          fact that the ground was frozen, one claim
          averaged $1000 in pay dirt a day, and a num?
          ber of claims changed hands at $60,000 each.
          Within the last twelve months 4000
          miners from the Klondike have rushed to the
          new fields.* They were the first to hear the
          news. All durW.g the winter hundreds strug?
          gled thither over snow and ice. Indications
          point to a remarkable rush northward from
          Seattle this string.
          Fairbanks, the centre of the Tatiana
          region, consisted a year ago of a few log
          cabins. To-day it is a prosperous city of over
          three thousand people, with all the conven?
          iences of modern city life.
          AS SOON as boats are able to navigato the
          inland streams of Alaska, a great summer
          rush to Tanana is expected to begin. Re?
          ports from Seattle state that gold-seekers
          aro crowding therj from all parts of the country.
          A surprisingly large number are outfitting as
          though they had been in mining regions beforo nnd
          knew how to arrange for the long and tiresomo trip
          by steamer, dog team and afoot. , 1
          ' Freight charges from Seattle to Dawson in
          eummer average over $7d a tori, and as much moro
          from .Dawson to Fairbanks, so that the cost of tak?
          ing along an extensive equipment is considerable.
          It is estimated that the Tanana region pro?
          duced $1,500,000 in gold last year, when tho num?
          ber of miners was insignificant, compared with the
          great army that will camp alonar its streams this
          season.
          Before news of tho rich'finds penetrated beyond
          ,the silent forests, pioneer prospeotorj had quietly
          taken out a quarter of a million in yellow metal
          flakes.
          Until the new trails were broken aud in use,
          Tanana was not an easy section of Alaska to reach
          or leave, and travelers along that way wero scarce?
          consisting principally of Indians hunting game or
          stray prospectors nosing about for gold.
          Situated on tho Tanana river, tho town of
          Fairbanks is 150 miles southeast of tho point of
          juncture pf that river with'the mighty Yukon; Daw
          eon, in the Klondike, is 500 miles away to the oast
          ward by sledgo trail, and to the south Valdez, on
          the coast, is 5?i miles distant.
          Discoverers of gold along tho Tanana wore not
          inclined to shout tho glad tidings to the world.
          Among those patiently .washing dift there dur?
          ing the fall of 1002 wa*'a secretivo individual, a
          Mexican, known as Pedro,
          Pedro, like the others, lived in a little hut. His
          bed was a blanket; chairs and table Avere simply
          blocks of -wood. He had little use for the cabin, ex?
          cept as a placo to sleep and store his provisions.
          All the long arctic days ?ho searched soil along
          the streams for gold, usually alone in the vast wil?
          derness. At other places w? re other men'similarly
          engaged, but they, too, were'there for business and
          had little time for sociability. '
          Ono day Pedro made" a big strike. Ho found
          gold that turned out $100 to, the. pan. Pedro was
          a rich man. Then he went away to the couth. But
          he didn't spread the news-?he was faithful to tho
          miners left behind. >
          Others, too, were lucky. Stray prospectors
          came that Avay andimmediately'located claims.- It
          seemed as if somo had smelled the good news from
          distant camps.,
          For months this handful of men struggled
          fiercely to wash all the gold they could before tho
          mad rush they knew was coming, sooner or later.
          First to arrivo Avere some steamboat men Avho
          had ascended the river with supplies for tho trading,
          post just opened at Fairbanks. These men heard
          of the marvelous new field and promptly staked
          claims there.
          Among them was an energetic Japanese named
          Wada, Avho, like others of his race, had been in
          many mining camps of the far North.
          For some reason, as soon as ho had ctaked his
          claim and learned of the richness of the region,
          Wada started out on a long, lono tramp over the
          snow, with a dog team drawing his ? ipplies, for
          Dawson) BOO mi lea away.
          No trail liad been broken -or at least half the
          distanco, butWada. plunged along, helping the dogs
          and Making from fifteen to twenty-five inilos a day.
          He wns tho first to bear the news of Tanana'a
          wealth to Bawsou, and minors of the older Klondike
          region immediately Avent wild.
          This was in the Avintor of.lOO'i?an exception?
          ally cold season, even in Alaska.
          Without waiting for spring, -.rimers hurried off
          in hundreds for a 6U0-mile journey over snow and
          ice, and through a.roadless -yilderness, in a tem?
          perature from 50 to CO degreed below ?ero.
          Hastily authoring what supplies thoy could,
          some left Bawson in small sleighs drawn by horses,
          others with ?log teams; but the greater number
          hurried along on foot, drawing their sleda them-,
          ? 'selves. '. ? ?
          '?, It was a mad rush for g?ld^:3ir?ny.reached tha
          ?new field before spring, ?but hundreds of others
          came'toiling in all during tho sunom?f. '.,.'
          , "When the majority arrived thoy, found the best
          claims'already taken, a shortago of, supplies facing
          them, and discouragement in tho air.
          Wada had returned with the rush. When some
          of the men realized their position, they brga?niged'
          a miners' meeting and decided to hang the' Jap.
          A rope Avas found, and Wada was about to be
          strung tip, when ho produced a copy ?f a Seattle
          newspaper, showing that he had onco saved the
          lives of many whalers, ico-impriaoned in the Arctic
          Ocean by tramping overland from Point Barrow to,
          St. Michael in dead of winter.
          This saved his life, but "Wada Avas driven from
          the region to which he had invited tho rush.
          In spite of their first disappointment, tho new?
          comers spread out and set to work. At this time
          gold was only known to exist along one creek. Soon
          it" was found along a dozen creek's.
          In the spring tho rush from Bawson continued
          by steamboat. Olairas were located in overy direc?
          tion. Now hundreds who arrived late, or Avho found
          that thoir claims did not pay, ar.o working as labor?
          ers for tho moro fortunate.
          In a little Avhilo, too, all thb surface gold had
          been panned, so that it became noces?ary to work
          the underground strata by machinery.
          ; When'tha Klondike Avaa struck, the only method .
          known of thawing the frozen ground for sinking
          ehafta and running tunnela was to build Avood fires
          on the surface, scrapo away the earth as far as it
          had thawed, build other fires and keep this tedious
          process up indefinitely.
          Already at Tnnana steam thawers aro being
          used, and steam"ia also employed to movo the wind?
          lass buckets that lift the earth.
          Theeo steam engines and boilers aro brought
          from the etistern United States at great expense.
          It is estimated that there ore now about one hun?
          dred and fifty at work in the Tnnana region, and
          many more are expocted this1 spring.
          Iron pipes with hojes in ono end inject the
          steam into tho frozen ground. An enormouaamount
          of-fuel is required to feed theso boilora, and it.is
          estimated that fully one-fifth tho laborers in tha
          Tannini country are engaged in cutting and hauling
          wood.
          This wood costs from $7 to .$10 a cord, and as
          each camp burns thousands .of cords a winter, it ia
          fast becoming scarce.
          Hydraulic methods of mining will bo employed
          this Bummer, when the soft surf ace way bo swept
          away very offec'ually. Machinery for this work is
          also expensive, and freight rates to the interior aro
          enormous.
          The best-paying claims so far located nro on
          Fairbanks, Cleary, Gold Stream and Pudro creel?.
          Scattered all along theso etreama and their
          numerous tributaries are tho hottics of tho miners.</text>

        <text>Alaska receives but what is her due
          in the Semi-Centennial edition of the
          Seattle Post Intelligencer, published
          Sunday November 7, number which
          arrived in Seward in the last mail.
          All through the edition Alaska is mentioned but in particular in the section “Arrival of
          the Gold Ship/’ A
          full page colored illustration shows
          a pan of gold dust being scattered
          among the eager throng of people
          standing on the dock. A brief foreward states word of the Alaska gold
          rush spread immediately, firing the
          imagination of adventurous men in
          every corner of the country, as tales
          of treasure always have done. Seattle
          was soon the shipping point of a
          great Alaska-bound movement and
          all resources were diverted to equipping and furnishing transportation to
          the eager goldsearchers.
          Seattle admits that with the arrival
          of the first gold shipment from the
          Klondike the commercial aspect of
          the city was changed.
          Alaska since has poured millions into Seattle business channels, it Is
          stated. Alaska gets little help from
          the nation, writes Scott C. Bone, former governor of the Territory, in a
          special article and then goes on to
          describe though Alaska has belonged
          to the United States for 59 years and
          fourteeen administrations have come
          and gone, but intermittent attention
          has been given to this remote and
          still undeveloped Territory. He describes interestingly “Seward’s Folly,’’
          Roosevelt’s administration and Alaska, and the building of the Alaska
          railroad under the Wilson administration, the Harding and the present
          Coolidge’s administration attitude toward Alaska.
          The number of employes in the
          coal mines of the United States has
          decreased 11 per cent and production
          has increased 162 per cent, according
          to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
          Metal production in the Eastern
          States increased 11 per cent during
          1925 over the year 1924, gold being
          valued at $50,090,000 and other metals
          at $22,068,792. </text>

          It’s a modern adaptation of the
          Alaska gold rush. With milk bringing around four bits a quart in
          Anchorage, the milk pan has become a rival of the gold pan in
          A'aska.
          The cows are heading for the
          Matanuska Valley, near Anchor-
          \ age.
          It is the vanguard of a 45-cow

          movement by air. The ‘‘flying
          Dr-4.
          Merle Anderson of Palmer, in
          the Matanuska Valley, went along
          as- the cows’ caretaker. He planned to milk five of them during
          the flight. Along with his milk
          stool, he afto took a .38 revolver
          just in case any of the four-legged
          passengers should go berserk at
          10 000 feet up.
          Anderson said it is cheaper by
          about $85 per cow to ship by sea,
          but the buyers expect to make up
          • the difference by milk sales during the period the cows would be
          at sea. Also, the Matanuskans are
          wary of what seasickness might do
          to a cow’s milk production.
          Additional cows will be shipped
          by sea later—during their dry
          seasons.
          ^ Anderson said there now are
          about 350 cows in the Alaska valley, but theiy fail to fill the Anchorage demand.
          Additional milk
          is flown from here twice a week.
          The cows were separated in the
          plane by board barriers. They

          Thomas Rodgers. 76, who said he
          was the father of a Buffalo, N. Y.,

          He started life anew first as a

          GENERAL MANAGER OHLSON OF THE ALASKA
          RAILROAD SAYS NEW RATE HAS BEE?
          GRANTED FROM MATANUSKA COAL FIELD!
          TO SEWARD TO PERMIT COMPETITION WIT!
          OUTSIDE PRODUCERS IN EFFORT TO CONTROL MARKET AMONG CANNERIES ANI
          GOVERNMENT VESSELS TO WESTWARD
          MAY BUILD BUNKERS HERE WHEN TONNAGE JUSTIFIES.
          After months of negotiation during which rates have been agreed
          upon ,a large coal movement from
          the Matanuska branch of the Alaska Railroad to tide water at Port of
          Seward is practically assured for
          next season, according to Otto F.
          Ohlson, general manager of the
          railroad who was in Seward this
          week on a final inspection before
          his departure for Washington tomorrw where he goes to lay a report before the Secretary of
          the I11-
          tericr.
          As a starter the coal will be yardstacked here in thousand tons lots
          or more ready for the fishing boats,
          the vessels of the Bureau of Fisheries, craft of coast guard, geodetic
          survey besides canneries, stores and
          residents. The railroad will build
          bunkers here as soon as the tonage warrants, Mr. Ohlson said.
          The new departure is being
          made possible by contracts now
          being signed up between the big
          cannery corporations of Southeastern Alaska and the Evan Jones Coal
          o, which is producing a superior
          grade of steaming coal in the Matanuska field coupled with a new ra^e
          granted by the railroad from the
          mine to the ships of $1.50 per ton,
          giving the coal company an opportunity to compete with Outside
          shippers with a superior coal.
          A representative of the. Evan
          Jones Co., is now in Seattle negotiating with the canning companies
          but it is understood that enough
          contracts have already been signed
          up to insure a large tonnage and
          make the new rate attractive.
          Mr. Ohlson expressed himself as
          highly pleased with the new arrangement as an entering wedge

        <text>SEATTLE GROUP GIVES NOME
          SPECIAL MENTION
          SEATTLE'S "GOOD WILL" concert tour of Alaska
          worked both ways, as the enthusiastic University of Washington Men's Glee Club returned to
          Seattle by PAA clipper.
          Sent by the Seattle Chamber of Commerce and
          many businessmen of Alaska to promote good will
          for the city of Seattle within the Territory, the tour
          resulted in fostering better understanding of Alaska's problems among the group of
          prominent
          University students, according to Dean Charles W.
          Lawrence ,director of the group said.
          "We found Alaskans are the most hospitable people in the world," said the dean.
          "Everywhere we
          went they were most receptive to our music—and
          very charming hosts besides!"
          Typical of the reception they received in all of
          the cities, was their visit to Nome. Flying to this city
          by PAA clipper from Fairbanks, the pilot of the
          plane took them out over the Bering Sea ice fields
          where the Alaska Steamship Company's motorship lumper Hitch was stuck, trying for a week
          to
          bring supplies to Nome. Sightseeing through the
          town, including a trip to one of the largest gold
          dredges, was followed by an elaborate dinner presented by the civic leaders of that city.
          The NOME NUGGET summarizing the thoughts
          of Alaskans throughout the Territory wrote editorially:
          Nome is indeed grateful to the City of Seattle
          and many Alaska businessmen who made it possible for the Territory to hear the University
          of Washington Glee Club.It is a gracious and neighborly gesture of good will.....
          In celebrating the fiftieth anniversary of the gold
          rush to Alaska, the businessmen of Seattle were
          aware that something should be done, and laid
          plans for a grand celebration in Seattle during the
          summer.
          But on second thought came forth with the idea
          that Alaskans could not participate fully during
          their busiest season, so evolved the idea of sending
          the Glee Club on a tour of Alaska.
          Again Seattle, we thank you."
          We can only say that if Seattle can be proud of
          its "gift to Alaska" in the Glee Club tour, that Alaskans can feel satisfied that their
          hospitality was
          more than equal to the occasion, as acknowledged
          by Seattle.</text>

        <text>Jack Hugh Lee
          Leaves Kodiak
          By JO and BOB BAITER
          Alaskan sourdough John
          Hugh Lee, known to all his
          friends as Jack, left Kottk last month for Wide Bay,
          tip the Alaskan mainland,
          where he expects oil companies to begin drilling this
          saauser and he airs to be in
          rn the ground floor. Jack is
          eighty-five years old and fiftytwoof those yean have been
          0CBt prospecting in the terriJad Lee says, ‘‘I am going'
          •a hwJd a cabin which will * do
          Hr a post office for the time1
          There is a lot of brush ( ti he cleared away oa my
          iMvrtead and in July I’m geiag to cat some hay for
          horses.”
          Born in Canada, near Perth,
          Ontario, he speaks kindly of
          that country’s beech, maple
          and hickory trees and tells of
          white frost on the praries
          near Calgary that wouldn’t
          wet your shoes.
          At the age of fourteen Jack
          was driving a team of horses
          carrying grub for the Candadian army during an Indian
          uprising in the Northwest
          territory. He worked his way
          clear across the continent
          railroading and mining. While
          prospecting near Sandon,
          British Columbia, he hoard
          about the Alaskan gold rush.
          After dreaming about gold
          nuggets the size of hen’s
          eggs he hurried to Seattle.
          On the 9th day of April, 1898
          Jack arrived in Cook Inlet and
          went ashore at Sunrise on
          Tumagain Arm. This first summer in Alaska he blazed a
          trail with a Captain Glenn, of
          the U Si Arftiy, from Knik 4o
          Big Delia and on to Fairb nks.
          In ihe spring of 1900 Jack
          teamed up with Hans Stevens
          and together they set out to
          prospect the Alaskan main-;
          land. Their first stop was Cold
          Bay and on the 1st of August!
          instead of finding gold they i
          discovered oil. The seepage1
          amounted to about 15 gallons a 1
          day.
          That winter Jack teamed up
          with Captain Lathrop and together they pushed the idea of
          oil development on the mainland. This was only the begin-'
          ning, and during the next fi'f* (
          teen years they worked p»-|
          gether up and down the coast
          of Alaska. >
          During Jack’s fifty-two I
          years in the territory he ha*
          prospected, mined coal, fur
          traded, piloted steamships, |
          watched and felt the Katmai
          volcanic eruption of 1912 from j
          only 19 miles away, and pla-j
          cermined on Kodiak Island.1
          Only a novel could hold all of
          the tales that are to be told
          about this remarkable man’s,
          life.
          Anna May Vokacek, U. S.
          [Commissioner, says, “Jack
          I Lee has known me since I was
          a baby. Mother, Mrs. Jessie j Mary Dolen, has known him
          since the days when Valdez j was a boom town.’’
          When asked about her re- j
          action to Jack’s trip to Wide
          Bay this spring, Anna May
          said, “Once it gets in theirj
          blood, it never gets out It’s*
          always the next shovel full or j
          the next pan full.’’ j
          All that any of uS can say is i
          “Good luck, Jack!” </text>

        <text>Now a New Gold Rush to Alaska
          Nezvs of Pay Dirt Near the Town of Ruby, on the Yukon, Has Started Hordes of Men on
          the Trail Again—The Old Days of Nome and Fairbanks Are in the Air, as Gold
          Seekers From the Territory and From Far Dozen the Pacific Coast Crozvd In.
          BY JOHN L. COONTZ.
          /S Alaska destined to witness an*
          other gold rush?
          Are thousands of men des
          tined to take the trail again
          through the passes of its snow
          clad mountains and river-gorged val
          leys, as they did in 1898-9, lured by the
          most magic of all nature’s minerals?
          Gold! Yellow gold, dust or nugget, is it
          again to sway the life of that most
          northern outpost of American civilisa
          tion?
          For a new gold strike has been made,
          g new gold cache of Old Mother Barth’s
          been discovered.
          From Ruby, on the Yukon, last Feb
          ruary the word leaked through. A
          strike In the Poorman sector of the
          southern portion of the peninsula, 60
          miles south of the aforesaid city of
          Ruby.
          Jack Wolfe, old prospector, veteran
          of many a gold trek through the Alas
          kan country, made the strike. Work
          ing along a creek that has come,
          through years of association on his
          part, to bear the name of Wolfe Creek,
          he came upon the precious metal in
          paying quantities. Quickly the word
          spread. Before long it had been carried
          to Ruby, locked in the ice and cold.
          Yet, despite the hardships that faced
          a trek into the new El Dorado land,
          men flung themselves on the trail.
          Forty, 50, 60 below zero had no terror
          for them; blizzard, snow depth, waste
          intimidated them not. Gold, yellow, glit
          tering gold, was their quest; gold was
          in their eyes; gold, do or die, their cry.
          rpnOUGH Spring, now here, had to be await
          ed for before claim working could be un
          dertaken, the gold-seekers were down in the
          Poorman quarter by the tens and twenties
          staking claims. Four pegs had to be set and
          then a flying trip to the nearest United State*
          land office to file on them. In the free-for-all
          scramble opportunity was his who seized it.
          Six to twenty dollars a pan runs the strike,
          according to those who have been down and
          over the lays. And that is mighty good pay
          dirt —especially at the higher bracket, for that
          means an ounce of gold at every pan. The
          pay streak as reported is 80 feet wide, possibly
          more, and running for a mile or more.
          Today, at Ruby, the influx of gold-seekers
          from over Alaska and far down the Pacific
          Coast is great. The stir In the little city is
          great. For the ice is going out of the river
          and the boats are coming in. And with them
          hordes of men. And across from Fairbanks
          and Nome others are coming, all hoping to get
          In on the bonanza for all it is worth.
          About the little town, frozen in for the most
          part of the year, the bearded, rough crew is
          milling. Dogs are being bought for the trail
          at almost any price. Grub is in high demand
          and Ruby merchants are laying in a plentiful
          supply. A restlessness pervades the air; man
          and beast are straining at the leash. One
          can’t get packed and on the trail soon enough.
          Every day means loss of time, and loss of
          t.imp means loss of potential fortune. The old
          days of Nome and Fairbanks are in the air.
          Days when gold was panned from the beach of
          the former city, not hundreds’, nor thousands',
          but hundreds of thousands’ and even millions’
          worth of it.
          And Ruby is going like Nome. Nome, to
          day, a town of some 3,000 inhabitants, had, in
          the heyday of its gold rush, 12,000 souls. Ruby,
          likewise, is witnessing the same motley, non
          descript influx. Places of entertainment are
          springing up like mushrooms; stores to take
          care of the prospector’s wants. The crook is
          there and the gentleman; the hobo and the
          wealthy adventurer.
          J-JOW long will this stir, this feverish
          activity last? It all depends—depends on
          the size of the strike. If gold has been found
          in rich, paying quantity afld its distribution is
          determined over a great area, there is the
          possibility of the “rush” lasting as long as did
          the Nome or Fairbanks “rush,” or that other
          great “rush,” one of the greatest in the his
          tory of gold—the Klondike one. Only inten
          sive working of the area can determine what
          the strike will develop into. With the slipping
          of Spring into Summer, longer and warmer
          days on the card, the sector will be worked
          out thoroughly. Men will swarm over it like
          flies over molasses cake, up and down the
          creeks there, looking, sifting, washing, peering
          Into the bottom of their shallow pans, stirring
          with their fingers the residue of their “wash,"

          'J'HE story of gold in Alaska li one
          of the most intriguing in the long
          list of stories built around man’s
          eternal search for it, long regarded as
          the most precious, the most desired of
          all metals. Gold will not tarnish, it la
          quite ductile, can be hammered into
          very thin alloyed sheets and still retain
          its character, is beautiful to look at and,
          by virtue of agreement among the
          civilized nations of the world, accepted
          as the standard of monetary value by
          all. It makes charming ornaments,
          rings, earrings, watches, chains, neck
          laces and whatnot. And because of all
          these things it is most sought after by
          men.
          It is found in many parts of the
          world, but chiefly in mountainous sec
          tions, for it is associated with Igneous
          rock, rock produced by heat—earth's
          interior heat —and cast up at some re
          mote geological time to the surface of
          the earth. Here erosion does the rest,
          in so far as flake and nugget gold is
          concerned.
          So when gold was first discovered in
          Alaska, back in the early eighties, men
          began to turn hopefully to that frozen
          country in search of rich deposits of it.
          Placer mining became the order of the
          day, washing gold out of stream soil
          where it had been deposited by the
          stream.
          However, Alaska as a great gold coun
          try did not come into its own until
          1898 and 1899, the date of the discov
          ery of gold at Nome and the develop
          ment of the field. Os this discovery and
          the subsequent activity that followed it
          there are many men tnrougnout tire country
          still living who were, like Priam at the siege of
          Troy, a party to it. The terrible hardship and
          frenzy of that period has not seen a counter
          part to this day, in so far as the United State*
          is concerned. It is rivaled only by the “rush”
          to California in '49 and to the Klondike fields
          in Canada. ‘•Stampede.” the word used by
          those who have been witnesses of a "rush," is
          the only word in the English language that de
          fines accurately the wild, blind fury of men on
          the trail. Every form of suffering Is there;
          every form of succor and mercy; every form of
          brutality; every form of generosity. Men, ac
          cording to the bias of their nature, either rise
          to the spiritual heights or sink to the depths of
          hell. The ‘•stampede” for gold tears away the
          veneer of civilization and leaves stark naked
          man, elemental man fighting it out to the end
          of the trail with his fellow man, nature and the
          bright angels of his nature.
          production in Alaska for 1928, was
          . $6,845,000; for the year 1929, it was esti
          mated to be, as of January 1, 1930, $7,748,000.
          Since 1880 the total output of gold from our
          northern possession is set at $373,000,000, a
          percentage of return on a paltry investment
          unequaled in the annals of the world Mn
          only in the case of one, that made by Thomas
          Jefferson while he was President, lids coun
          try gave Russia $7,200,000 for Alaska In IW7.
          Last year’s gold production alone in the terri
          tory would have paid for it.
          The biggest single gold year in Alaska was
          1906 during which year $18,000,000 worth of
          gold was produced. It was the peak of the
          Nome fever period. By that year placer min
          ing had been replaced largely by machine proc
          ess mining, a fact that accounted for the
          huge total. Men, in speaking of these years at
          Nome, recall seeing on more than one occasion
          two, three, four and five million dollars of gold
          bullion piled on the wharf at Nome awaiting
          shipment out of its native environment.
          Today, gold mining in Alaska on a large
          scale is machine process mining. Dredges are
          used to lift the soil and handle it through a
          washing process to the end that it yields up its
          treasure. One sees little of the mining methods
          save where the prospector roams and works out
          by himself or with his “pard” a claim. Dredges
          charge 30 cents per yard for their work and
          there are, in round numbers, 150 pans tp the
          yard.
          The present discovery of gold in pairing
          quantities Will have a boom effect upon Alaska,
          declares Dr. Philip Smith of the Alaskan divis
          ion of the Geological Survey at Washington.
          ‘‘lt,” said Mr. Smith, “will focus attention
          upon that distant possession of ours, bringing
          to the mind of the average American citizen
          something in the way of knowledge of its un
          suspocted beauties and wealth. The airplane
          and the radio have changed this once almost
          God-forsaken country, cold, mountainous,
          rocky. Valleys it has, of course, beautiful as
          any on earth, with blooming gardens and ricn
          pastures filled with cattle and hogs.
          “Inaccessible, practically, a few years ago.
          today it has a railway line reaching from
          Seward to Fairbanks, a distance of 470 miles,

          t the daylight-saving bill by Con- j
          ress.
          Physicians here to-day also were j
          f the opinion that tho new sched- j

          Businessmen generally tli rough-out the city this afternoon declared
          that the changing of hours would
          be accomplished without interrupt
          ing or hurting trade. It was said
          that tho change would mean little
          or nothing to the larger mills ahd
          munitions plants, where three shifts
          of men now ure engaged in working !
          throughout the twenty-four hours, j
          No difficulty will be experienced in
          trolley car schedules, it was said at
          the offices of the Harrisburg and
          'cross-river traction companies and
          the turning of the watch will do
          the trick. ' i
          Theaters, railroads and every bus-
          iness house in the city will operate
          according to the now schedule, and,
          therefore, it was pointed out, there
          can be 110 confusion after a man
          has once reset his watch.
          Summed up, Mr, Littlefleld says:
          "The bill provides tor an hour
          advance in standard time at 2
          o'clock a. in. on the last Sunday
          in .March of each yefcr and at
          . a. m. the lust Sunday in October
          uie standard time shall be retarded
          one hour. Eleven countries have
          adopted the summer daylight sav-
          ing plan. The first was Germany,
          then Great Britain, France, Austria-
          Hungary, Italy, Sweden, Denmark,
          Norway, Holland, Portugal and Au-/
          stralla. London, England, saved
          200,000 tons of coal during a sum
          mer. In England in five and one
          half months $12,000,000 in coal '.vere
          saved, and In France $10,000,000. It
          is estimated that in the United States
          $10,000,000 can be saved in light
          bills. The hour of daylight con
          served by the proposed law can be
          used by industrial workers throug
          out America for gardening and agri
          cultural work. This will be a most
          important gain. We are sure of a
          great shortage in farm labor this
          summer and something must be done
          to offset the probable loss in pro
          duction of farm products. The hour
          saved for daylight every day in April.
          May, June, July, August, September
          and October will be of inestimable
          value in stimulating the dwellers in
          cities and towns to interest them
          selves in the production of garden
          truck."

          SAVING BILL;
          AWAITS WILSON
          Clocks All Over Country Will
          Be Turned Ahead
          One Hour
          Wusliington, Mar. 16—The House
          of Representatives, by 252 to 40. yes
          terday passed the Senate daylight
          saving bill, under the terms of
          which, when it receives the signa
          ture of President Wilson, it'will be
          required that all the clocks in the
          United States be turned ahead one
          hour at 2 a. m. 011 Sunday, March
          31, and remain advanced one hour
          until 2 a. m. on the last Sunday in
          October.
          Under the bill parsed by the
          Senate the limit was, fixed as the
          last Sunday in September. The
          House amendment extending the
          daylight saving one month was
          adopted upon representations by-
          Fuel Administrator Garfield that a
          great amount of l'uel would be con
          served thereby. It is expected that
          the Senate will concur in the amend
          ment to-morrow.
          Five standard time zones for th
          United States will be fixed by the
          Government, according to the bill,
          and it is made mandatory upon the
          railroads to follow the standard
          time.
          By the passage of the bill, tho
          United States joins with England,
          France, Switzerland, Portugal and
          the three Scandinavian countries in
          adopting a method of economy and
          efficiency first taken by Germany
          during the early days of the war.
          Millions of tons .of coal have been
          saved in these countries, it was
          stated to the House to-day by the
          supporters of the measure, by the
          simple means of turning the clock
          ahead over a period of five or six
          months a year.
          England reports a saving of 12,-
          000,000 tons up to date. Several
          Representatives who espoused tha
          bill admitted that when it was first
          proposed they considered it silly.
          But, they said, when they came to
          examine its virtues they fell enthu
          siastically behind it.
          Provided the President signs it,
          and there is little doubt that he will
          do so quickly, the daylight-saving
          bill will have the effect of turning
          us all out of bed an hour earlier
          than we have been accustomed-to
          arise and of sending us back again
          accordingly. The use of fuel at
          night will be conserved by the clos
          ing of establishments at 11 o'clock
          which ordinarily do business until
          12 o'clock. By the clock on the wall
          it will still be 12 o'clock, but by
          the moral conviction it. will be 11.
          Officials of the Chamber of Com
          merce and the Bourse, two of the
          many local organisations which car
          ried the light for the daylight-sav
          ing bill into the very halls of Con
          fess. were jubilant on receipt of
          the news that the legislation was
          so near. Ernest T. Trigg, president
          of the Chamber of Commerce, said:
          "This is very gratifying to us. By
          a readjusting of working hours the
          war industries will be speeded up
          materially and more time for the
          cultivation of war gardens will re
          sult."
          Emil P. Albrecht, president of the
          Bourse, said:
          "This legislation will enable work
          ers to get better results out of their
          daily efforts, as they will be in bet
          ter tune for speeding up operations
          in the early daylight hours of the
          summer months. In such a large
          manufacturing center as Philadel
          phia the gain in efficiency in the
          various war work lines will be tre
          mendous. Only on Monday last the
          directors of the Bourse urged upon
          Congress for the second time within
          two months the necessity for this
          change."</text>

          These charts show vividly how the daylight saving plan will give j
          everybody more "free hour#" of daylight. You've heard this: "Well,!
          there are just so many hours of daylight in a day and you can't change j
          'em." But wait?the daylight hours before your work-day itarts are
          so-called "wasted hours"?you ?leep them away or spend them getting
          ready to go to work. The daylight saving plan merely "shifts" an
          hour of daylight to the "free hours" after work, when you can use it.
          The tables is based on the average June day and the workday from
          8 to 5 includes an hour for lunch.
          Moving the Clock.
          The clock will be set forward one
          hour at 2 a. m., March SI, according
          to the House bill. At the same hour
          on October 27, the clock will be set
          back.
          The present standard time rones
          will remain in effect.
          Both changes will take place on
          Sunday mornings so that the least
          possible wrench may be given to
          the industrial fabric of the nation.
          But even at that on the railroads
          alone there will be some 1.000 pas
          senger trains and 5.000 trains run
          ning on the tracks when the change
          comes, and 1,698.SIS railroad clocks

          Benefits of Plan.
          The following benefits will be
          reaped by the daylight-saving plan:
          Saving of one to one and a half
          million tons of coal per year, ac
          cording to Fuel Administration es
          timates.

          light-saving bill, pessed yesterday by
          the House, 252 to 40.
          Senator Calder, author of the
          ure In the upp?r braftch iftf Congress,
          said the House amendments would
          be agreed to, so that a conference
          would not be necessary.
          Provisions of Bill.
          The bill provides that at 2 o'clock
          p. m. on the last Sunday In March
          each year, clocks all over the country
          which affect any operations of the
          Federal government, or railroads,
          i shall be set ahead one hour. At 2
          j o'clock p. m., the last Sunday in Oc
          j tober of each year, they are to be
          i retarded one hour.
          j All business relating in any wayto the Federal government will be
          conducted on the time set. Further

          Standard Central time, etc.
          Inasmuch as commercial and labor
          organizations the country over have
          petitioned for the bill, Congress ex
          pects a general agreement with the
          law everywhere. The five sones are
          to be fixed by order of the Inter
          state Commerce Commission. But it
          Is directed in the bill to have "due
          regard" for present railroad classi
          fications. The unofficial understand
          ing is that no important change is
          to be made in present arrangements.</text>

        <text>Daylight Saving Is Simplicity Itself
          How Ben Franklin s Idea Conceived in 1784, Just Made Into Law Here, Will Affect
          Folks After Easter and Save Millions to the Nation
          10
          By WM. ARCHIBALD FERGUSON,
          Secretary of the National Daylight Sar
          ins Association.
          ON Ihc coming Apwl 1 more people
          in the United Slates will probably
          be April fool vietims than on any previ
          ous or future April 1, for Congress lias
          decreed that at 2 o'clock on the morning
          of March 31 the hands of the clock shall
          be turned forward one hour; in other
          words, the United States will then begin
          to live under the davlight saving plan,
          and doubtless thousands will forget to
          make the change.
          Every individual who is wise Jind hates
          to be fooled will before retiring on the
          evening prior to Kaster Sunday, March
          31, see to it that not onh his watch but
          every clock in the bou.se is turned for
          ward one hour. Otherwise on Sunday he
          will find the Easter services half over be
          fore he arrives at the church, and on
          Monday morning, April 1, VMS, rising
          an hour late, if he is a commuter he will
          miss his morning train by an hour and
          be greeted at the factory or office with
          such remarks as "April fool!" "You day
          light blacker! You forgot to turn your
          watch ahead, eh 7'' and all day long he
          will be the butt of many jokes.
          May Wait Lone for Dinner.
          If lie starts for home at the tame hour '
          as usual and has not during the day tele
          phoned his wife to turn the clock ahead
          be will have a long wail tor dinner. One
          thing Is certain, hotvivcr. that before he
          retires that night crry member of his
          household will know that the daylight pav
          ing plan is in effect and that the people
          of the United States are living an hour
          ahead of sun time.
          The daylight sating idea U almost as
          Id as the United States it-elf and our
          country can rightly claim the credit for
          all the many advantages which will act-rue
          from it, not only in this country bat also
          in those countries which anticipated the
          United Slates in its adoption, for it was
          Benjamin Pranklm who Iirst conceited
          the idea.
          On an early morning walk along the
          Etreels of Imdou in 17.S4 the thought Iirst
          came to him, and in passing if on to the
          world at large he said:
          ''In a walk through the Strand and Tit et
          ttrect one morning at 7 o'clock I ob.-Ttcd
          then; was not one shop open, although
          it had been davlight ami the sun up
          above three hours, the inhabitants of
          lxndon choo.-iug voluntarily to live by
          candle light and sleei by sun-bine; and
          yet often complaining :t little absurdly of
          the dnty on candles and the high price
          of tallow.''
          Soon thereafter in the Jtwrnal Je
          Faris he publL-hcd an article, later ap
          pearing among his es-ays under the title
          4An Economical Project," which further
          elaborated the advantages of daylight sav
          ing; namely, of "Turning the clock for
          ward an hour" so that everybody would
          live one hour longer by davlight and one
          hour less by artificial light.
          Beaten Repeatedly in Britain.
          Tor many years in England in the
          last century Sir William Willctt annually
          introduced his davlight sating bill in Par
          liament and annually the bill wa- de
          feated amid laughter and ridicule.
          In 1915 Germany tirst adopted the plan
          to speed np the war production and io
          benefit by the tremendous saving in fuel
          consumption. France and England and
          nil other European countries except Rus
          sia soon alter followed her example.
          Since its adoption in Europe, the.
          United State.-, Canada and Mexico have
          been out of harmony, so far as time was
          concerned, with European countries, to
          their loss not only in business, for the
          stock exchanges of Ixindon and Paris un
          der the new plan were closed before the
          exchanges of New York and I tost on were
          open, but also as regards the tremendous
          savings pos-ible in light bills, which, it
          is estimated, annually will run from V0,
          000,000 to $50,000,000 in the United
          Sfates alone.
          The plan has been ardently advocated
          in this country since May, Wlfi, by the
          Merchants Association of this city, cham
          bers of commerce of Boston, Rochester,
          Philadelphia, Chicago and Pittsburg, the
          United States Chamber of Commerce,
          Washington, D. C, and the National Day
          light Saving Association, of which Marcus
          M. Marks, former Borough President of
          Manhattan, is the president. Mr. Marks
          has often been called the '"'father of day
          light saving in this country."
          To illustrate the effect of the. plan, let
          us follow Jack Hurryup, a New York
          commuter, through his first business day
          under the new regime.
          Mr. Hurryup is a habitual reader of
          The Scn, and accordingly he knows he
          should on the evening of March 30 turn
          his watch and clocks ahrad one hour be
          fore he retires at 9 o'clock. But on the
          night of Easter Sunday he goes through
          the house from the kitchen to the
          roof and advances each clock one hour
          and is surprised when he arritis iu his
          bed chamber and looks at his watch to
          lind that he is retiring at 10:1.1 instead
          of i:15 his lirst shock from daylight
          saving.
          The alarm dock rings louder than
          usual the next morning and he. jumps out
          that several of his friends to whom he
          telephones have not yet arrived at the
          office, but are expected auy minntt.
          At 1 o'clock, his usual hour, he hurries
          to the restaurant for luncheon and finds
          a slim crowd. Upon returning to the of
          fice all is running smoothly and at quar
          ter of 5 he closes his desk to catch the
          5:15. As he passes through the gate at
          the Grand Central he sees the same fa
          miliar crowd starting on their nightly
          journey home.
          Ed, Kill and Dick are on hand for the
          nightly game of poker, .lack and his
          friend Ed were the losers in the game,
          for they spent most of their time joking
          Bill and Dick for being April fools aud
          having missed the train in the morning.
          Alighting from the commuters' special
          in the country, he is happily pleased to
          note that it has not vet begun to grow
          BENJAMIN FRANKLIN
          jr FROM THE ENGRAVING OF THE DUPLESSIS' PORTRAIT OF 1778
          Noted American philosopher is the father of daylight saving.
          of bed at C:.'J0, leans out of the window
          and noles that the sun is ju-t ri-ing, and
          then realizes that he is really getting up
          one hour earlier by the sun, although the
          alarm went off at the usual hour.
          He rushes through his bath and his
          breakfast and runs for the train. When
          he arrives at the station he is surprised to
          find many of his pals missing. The train
          pulls in and he runs to his customary scat
          in the smoker: the table and the cards
          are there, but only one plajcr besides
          himself. He greets Ed .(ones, who
          boarded the train at the station, above
          with:
          "Good April fool joke on Bill and
          Dick! Guess they forgot to turn their
          watches ahead last night. We'll have
          some sport with them to-morrow."
          Mr. Hurryup piles into the subway
          aud is astonished to lind a seat at the
          Grand Central, his second shock from
          the daylight saving. "Guess a lot of peo
          ple are fooled by this daylight saving
          this morning," he mutters to himself.
          He arrives at the office, looks at the
          clock to see whether he has consumed the
          usual time on his journey down town and
          is surprised to find that he is arriving
          at 8:1.1, the exact time at which he took
          the tram at his station. Shock No. 3.
          No oflice boy in sight. He rings for his
          stenographer and she greets him with a
          hearty "Good morning !" He tells her
          to get the porter immediately and turn
          that oflice clock ahead one hour.
          He finds no mail on his desk and con
          cludes that the letter carrier is also one of
          the daylight saving April fo;Is.
          The morning runs on as usual except
          dark and that the sun is still shining
          brightly at 0 o'clock. "We fooled ton to
          day. Old Sol, and will keep fooling you
          until November 1," he says to himself.
          Arriving at the house he goes to the
          cellar, and finding that he need not turn
          on the lights he gels out the lawn mower
          and bis garden tools.
          "This daylight sating is all right," he
          calls up fo Mary; ''don't hurry to get on
          the dinner. I am going to mow the lawn
          and wotk in the garden until sundown."
          " After an hour's work about the grounds
          .lack comes in to dinner and he anil Mary
          agree that daylight saving is the greatest
          boon ever conferred upon New York com
          muters. The chief benefits of the plan, as
          proved by the experience of England,
          France and other European countries
          where it has been in force, may be gen
          erally summarized under three heads:
          Eirst General health of all people
          benefited by reason of an added hour of
          daylight in the late afternoon, which has
          been and will be u-ed for outdoor recre
          ation and exercise.
          Second Increased production of food
          stuffs through the stimulating cultivation
          of home gardening.
          Third Money saved in lighting bills:
          each householder will burn artificial light
          one hour less each day, provided, of
          course, he continues his usual habits of
          retiring at night.
          The report of the summertime commit
          tee appointed by the British Parliament
          in September, 1!1G, to inquire into the
          social and economic results of the sum
          mertime act shows that the extra hour of
          dat light was generally ucd for the pur-po-e
          of outdoor recreation and pursuit's,
          and, in particular, for the cultivation of
          home gardening.
          The athletic dubs reported that the
          cricketers, bowlers, golfers and tennii
          players took full advantage of the extra
          hour of light, and swimming pools and
          playgrounds were utilized to full capac
          ity. Iu view of the national agitation last
          year, which is being renewed now, for
          the cultivation of home gardens to in
          crease the production of food the inaugu
          ration of the daylight saving plan iu this
          country will undoubtedly very greatly
          stimulate home gardening, particularly in
          the neighborhood of the great cities. In
          New York city alone there are 1,000.000
          daily commuters. Should only one-half
          of them use the extra hour of daylight
          which the plan will give in cultivating
          home gardens there will bo 3,000,000 extra
          hours utilized weekly in gardening and
          during the seven summer months in which
          the plan is in operation 2,000,000 days of
          extra work and time will be spent by
          these 500,000 commuters in the cultiva
          tion of gardens.
          What It Means in Potatoes.
          It has been estimated that if the av
          erage commuter wpre to work a plot of
          land only 20x-10 feet, which would le
          about I-50lh of an acre, and planted it all
          to potatoes, on the basis of 300 bushels
          per acre each commuter would he able
          to rai-e from four to live bushels of pota
          toes; on this basis half of the commuters
          of New York city would add to the potato
          crop during 191S approximately 2,500,
          0011 bushels.
          The saving in lighting bills ami in fuel
          u.-ed for producing electricity and gas
          wdl be tremendous. Public Service En
          gineer Robert L. Bruuct of Providence,
          If. I., has carefully estimated this saving
          and fixed the amount during the period of
          live mouths, which the plan originally
          contemplated, at $-10,000,000, and tiie
          amount of coal sated at 1,000,000 tons.
          This sating will he unitersal as every
          hou-eholder will u-e one hour les- of aili
          licial light daily under the new plan.
          Other additional benefits will be the re
          duction of traffic accidents due to Ici-cncd
          tran-poriation of pa'.sengers under arti
          ficial light, reduction of the danger of eye
          strain on account of the lessened amount
          of reading and work done under artiticial
          light and more lime for open air military
          drilling.
          The davlight sating hill as signed by
          President Wilson on March 19 provides
          lhat the plan shall go into effect at 2
          o'clock antemeridian time on Sunday
          morning, March 31, at which time clocks
          and watches, probably upon a signal
          flashed from the United States Naval
          Observatory at Washington will be
          turned ahead one hour. Comparatively
          very few individuals, unless by design,
          will be conscious w hen the change is
          made. "This hour was selected by reason
          of the fact that at 2 o'clock in the morn
          ing the number of railroad trains actually
          en route is smallest,
          Nobody Will Be Inconvenienced.
          Nobody will be seriously inconte
          ilienced, unless on Easter Sunday morn
          ing or on the night previous individuals
          forget to turn their clocks and watches
          forward an hour, as the result of which
          omission they may find at some time dur
          ing that daj- that they arc one hour be
          hind the rest of the country.
          The remarkable thing about the effect
          of the movement is that practically no
          class of business will be injured; the only
          exception is the open air moving picture
          exhibitors-, who under the new plan will
          be. unable on account of the sun's setting
          an hour later to begin their performance
          as early as they have been accustomed in
          previous years, which may result in a
          loss of patronage. The ordinary business
          man, as far as bis business is concerned,
          will not be affected in the slightest, ex
          cept that he will be more often tempted
          this summer to go to the baseball game
          which will begin at -1:30 o'clock instead
          of 3:30 and to run down more often to
          the beaches for a dip before dinner.
          Everybody under the new regime will
          continue his old habits rising, working,
          dining and retiring at the same hours;
          we will still live by the clocks and give
          the laugh to the cob.</text>

          Extra Daylight You'll Have to
          Chase Over the
          Green.
          JUST DO THIS AND BE CONTENT.
          8et all clocks and timepieces ahead
          One hour Just before retiring Saturday
          night.
          Those who are awake at 2 a. m.,
          Sunday, may wait until that hour to
          set their timepieces ahead one hour.
          Ahead—-forward—one hour. Under
          stand this and do it, and having done
          it, be content, nor worry any more
          about it.
          This simple Instruction, obeyed so
          thoroughly that every timepiece in
          the oountry la thus changed one hour
          ahead, will carry out the law and pre
          vent any confusion whatever. Every
          phase of life will move ahead with the
          cloaks—trains, street cars, business,
          religious services—everything. The 9
          o'clock trains Sunday morning will
          leave at 9 o'clock by the clock. The 7
          o'clock atreet cars will run at 7 o'clock
          by the clock—everything will be Juet I
          as it Is now, by the clock. And the riotic
          clock will be the only thing to rely on
          as
          It Is now. Just what!his
          the clock says, after It has been turned
          ahead one hour, that will be the time,
          and the time for everything, Just as It
          is now. There will be no change in
          anything except the clocks and
          watches, and no one need pay any at
          tention to the fact that they have been
          moved one hour ahead.
          Complete plans for the daylight sav
          ing system, which' goes into effect to
          morrow have been announced by fed
          eral officials and the nation's workers
          are ready to push the hands of the
          •clock one hour ahead to assist Uncle
          Sam In hig fight for liberty.
          Every city in the country, every
          town and village, everything is in
          readiness for the new system, a sys
          tem that will save the nation thou
          sands of tons of coal daily as well as
          assisting the working man, the shop
          girl and the laboring clasa as well as
          the busy office man.
          What this plan means to the nation
          can be described in a few words. In
          the first place It means the conserva
          tion of the fuel supply. Secondly,-it
          gives the average man more time to
          devote to gardening, which In turn
          means a "bigger supply of food for the
          nation and, thirdly, it means a more
          healthy nation.
          The work of the masses will be done
          In daylight, where, heretofore, it was
          done In the dark a certain number of
          hours a day.
          Favored by All.
          Since the plan was first spoken of
          it has attracted the attention of some
          of the biggest men in the country.
          Efficiency experts have studied the
          plans and in very instance have re
          turned a favorable report on their
          study.
          The action has been favored by
          President Wilson for the past several
          months. Garfield and Hoover have
          been ardent supporters of the plan.
          There has never been an argument
          against the system and every learned
          man in the country is of the J.rsllef that
          the plan will greatly aid the nation's
          savings.
          The daylight saving plan will give
          the following daily advantages:
          One hour or more for outdoor rec
          reation. Recreation is a national as
          set, an immense force for health and
          moral well-being.
          Working mothers and fathers obtain
          an extra hour for outdoor play with
          their children, both summer and win
          ter.
          One hour less for bad lights in tene
          ments.
          Lessened eyestrain for workers and
          school children due to the use of artifi
          cial light.
          Smaller risk of accident in indus
          trial establishments, because there
          jwill he a light hour instead of a dark
          one at the end of the working day at
          ,tlie time of greatest fati-gue and most
          {frequent accidents.
          Lessened risk of accidents due to
          I transportation and traffic conditions,
          because the afternoon rush will fall in
          iduylight Instead of darkness,
          Working girls will be on the way
          home in the daylight instead of in the
          !dark in winter.
          Our last hour of sleep will be sound
          ier and more 'beneficial than it is un
          der present conditions, because there
          will be less light.
          General efficiency will, of course, be
          •increased by any improvement in the
          (health morals and social welfare of
          tiie workers and others.

          temptation, which shall come upon
          all the world, to try them that dwell

          What became of that hour between
          2 a. m. and 3 a. m. Easter morning?
          Where did those sixty minutes go
          which were abolished from the face of

          the clocks ahead one hour. And every
          The earth Is approximately 24,000
          miles around. It makes a full turn in
          twenty-four hours, or travels at the.
          rate of say one thousand miles per
          hour. We poor mortals, clinging to
          the earth as best we can are being
          whirled around at this excessive rate
          of speed. We are going some. Yet
          Sunday morning at 2 o'clock, when the
          clocks were changed, we made an ex

          The sick man was to be given a pill
          every half hour. The nurse had been
          instructed to be very careful in fol
          lowing out the instructions. Some
          body changed the clock and she got all
          muddled up as to whether to give the
          dying, man two extra pills. It was a
          case of life and death. The nurse
          fainted and the poor sick man got no
          pills all night long. When the nurse
          regained consciousness, her patient
          had recovered and was out working in
          his war garden.
          The early worm had become tired

          the bird observed the new daylight

          way as usual.

          Easter Sunday of 1918 can always

          three hours. We used to think Decem

          year, but the war has changed many
          things and now Easter is the shortest.
          If shoving the clock ahead one hour
          is such a good thing, why not go a
          little further and shove the calendar
          ahead one month. Why not tear off
          April altogether and have May right
          now, thus avoiding the April show
          ers and have fresh vegetables and
          warmer weather right away? Or go a
          little further and shove the whole
          year ahead. That might see the end
          of the war six months behind. Good
          scheme for somebody with plenty of
          spare time to figure out and suggest

          »America—particularly the eastern
          half—is so badly tangled about Its
          time that nothing short of legislation
          by Congress can unravel the snarl.
          -Daylight saving has plunged every
          body Into confusion. Clocks are dif
          ferent. Time lablee are worse puz
          zles than ever. Traveling, you reach
          your destination earlier than you
          leave a distant point of departure:
          aäd, returning, It takes you two
          hours to travel for an hour!
          Different systems of daylight sav
          ing are In use. There is no co-ordin
          nation. Some cities have moved their
          clocks ahead. Others have refused.

          Farmer and city man are at war
          over the Issue. Farmers want the
          old Standard time; city dwellers
          want an extra hour of daylight in the
          summer.

          cilles In sixteen states, and one en

          Three time bills are how before

          Saving Association and the newly
          firmed Eastern Zone Daylight Sav

          n^t A. Ackerman, of New Jersey,
          providing for daylight saving In the
          nfstern time zone.
          The eastern time zone extends
          from the Atlantic ocean to a zigzag
          Mae drawn from the southern tip of
          Take Huron, to Detroit and Toledo,
          through Ohio, cutting off eastern
          Kentucky, a
          through Georgia by way of Atlanta
          ami Macon, and winding up at the
          western end of Florida on the Gull
          of Mexico,
          of Philadelphia!
          All of that territory should have
          the same time.
          BUT—
          New York and Boston have day
          light-saving time—and Philadelphia
          Baltimore and Washington have
          Eastern Standard time.
          Pittsburgh, Colun^bus. Buffalo ami
          Louisville have daylight-saving time
          —and Cleveland, Detroit and Rich
          mond have Eastern Standard time
          When It Is 3 o'clock In New York.
          It Is only 7 o'clock in Philadelphia
          Yet at the same moment It's R
          B'dlock In Pittsburgh. 400 miles west
          Philadelphia!
          And It's 7 o'clock in such widely

          than New York. Now Chicago and
          Philadelphia alike are an hour slow
          er than New York, while Omaha Is
          an hour slower than Chicago and
          two hours slower than New York.
          Columbus and Detroit are in a line,
          north and south. Yet each has a dif
          ferent time! Columbus moved ahead
          an hour and Detroit didn't.
          This confusing melange of times—
          many of which have little to do with
          the customary standards of sun and
          teography—is compiled from reports
          (lowing into the office of John R
          Young, secretary of the Eastern Zone
          Daylight Saving Association.
          "Daylight saving ia one war meas
          ure that unfortunately didn't hold
          over," says Young. "Congress passed
          the Caldcr bill in 1917. Great Brit

          Young calls the farmers the big
          gest factor against daylight savings.
          Reports are that some light com

          ice is concerned by allocating their
          rush-hour schedules an hour earlier.
          Daylight saving has been Inaugu
          rated in so many different ways that
          the confusion has been Increased. In
          addition, there Is not now any stand

          City with virtually all of the large
          cities' in the state, passed local ordinance effective April 24 and running
          for five months. Under the old law,
          daylight saving began the last Sunday in March und continued for seven months. Despite

          state law but cities have acted or are
          planning for summer time under local
          ordinance. Because of proximity to
          New York and thousands of residents
          who have business interests in New
          York, a large number of communities
          wero obliged to adopt daylight saving.
          Connecticut—Agricultural interests
          succeeding in passing a law pronimting daylight saving by local ordinance. This being
          overcome in some
          places by manufactures opening factories one hour ahead of usual time.
          New London plans daylight time by
          “common consent” after expressions
          in l'avof of this course had been issued by business men’s organization.
          Massachusetts—Daylight saving

          Vermont—Like New Hampshire

          1‘ennsylvania—Legislature defeated
          bill permitting municipalities to adopt,
          daylight saving laws, but another bill
          may be passed permitting municipalities to vote on changing time. Mean while Pittsburg is
          planning to put
          daylight saving into effect at 2 A. M.
          on April 24. A majority of cities in
          Western Pennsylvania have adopted
          It in the past. Financial houses in
          some of the cities are planning to
          conform daylight time because of
          New York action.
          Delaware—City of Wilmington and
          few suburban places adopted daylight time. Remainder state remains
          on standard time.
          Maryland — Legislature refused' to

          houses will follow New York time
          schedule.
          Illinois—Chicago went on summer
          daylight saving time by vote of the
          people in the election of last year and
          will continue to do so until this city
          ordinance is repealed. Accordingly a
          large number of the cities and towns
          in the Chicago district have also
          adopted the plan, but down state it
          ! lias not been put into effect. The

          the city of Chicago.
          Ohio—All bf the larger cities I Ohio Imre adopted the plan. Cleveland is on the Eastern

          Michigan—A score or more of
          Micl\igaa cities and towns are operating on f&astfrn standard
          time or are
          preparing to- move their cloaks ahead
          for the summer time. Detroit has

          years but the daylight saving measure has been adopted by Adrian, Battle Creek, Jackson,
          Grand Rapids,
          Kalamazoo, Owosso, Muskegan, Sault
          Ste. Marie, and Monroe. Lansing is
          the only large city in the state that
          will operate on Central Time this
          summer.
          > Indiana—Few cities or towns will

          to pass' the daylight saving measure intro¬ duced April 11 by Congressman Ernest
          R.«Ackerman, of New Jersey" providing" for daylight, saving in the eastern time zone.;_ a
          ,The eastern time zone extends, from "the Atlantic ocean to a zigzag* line drawn from the
          southern tip of; Lake Hjiron: to Detroit and Toledo, through' Ohio, cutting off Eastern
          Kentucky, a bit of Tennessee, through Georgia by way of,Atlanta and* Macon and wlndfng up
          at; the western end of Florida 5n the Gulfof Mexico. . How It's Muddled. All of that
          territory should have the same time. ' BUT. New York and Boston have day¬ light saving

          Cleveland. Detroit and Richmond have Eastern Stand¬ ard-time. When It is 8 o'clock In New
          York, it la only-7 o'clock,In Philadelphia. Yet at the same moment it's S o'clock in
          Pittsburgh, 400 miles west of Philadelphia! And It's 7 o'clock in such wide¬ ly separated
          cities as Philadelphia, Baltimore, Washington, Cleveland and Detroit and also in Chicago
          and Milwaukee.although the first five are in thVreaitern time zone' and tho latter two are
          In the cen: tral zone! A month ago Omaha .had the same time as. Chicago,' one hour slower
          than-New York. Now Chi¬ cago and Philadelphia alike are an hour ,Blower'.than New York,

            line, north and south. Yet each has
            a different time! Columbus moved
            ahead an hour and Detroit didn't.;
          This confasing melange of "times
          .many of which have little' to do with the customary standards of
            sun and geography.Is compllqd from reports flowing Into the of¬ fice of John R. Young, secretapr of the Eastern Zone Daylight Saving association.
          "Daylight saving is one war
          measure that unfortunate didn't hold over," says Young, "Congress passed the Calder bill in 1917. Great Britain and Franco still have day¬ light saving.but we repealed oiir
          measure in 1919.
          " President-Wilsrfn vetoed the ag¬ riculture appropriations bill in 1919 because it contained that provision for repealing daylight' saving^. Anfl
          Congress passed "ltf' over. his veto,
            August 20, 1919;', il' k 'f;: i.r >.
          "Opposition to daylight saving In
          national and state-legislatures is
          due to the time-honored superstl- tlon of the power of ' the (artner
            vote." ^

          . Young calls the farmers the big¬
          gest, factor against daylight sav¬
          ings. Reports art 'that some light companies and motion picture ex¬
          hibitors are against if. because of
          decreased revenues.

        <text>THE REPEAL OF THE DAYLIGHTSAVING LAW
          By Annie G. Porritt.
          WHATEVER one may feel about the repeal of the daylight saving
          law—and personally I greatly regret the prospect of losing next
          year our long summer daylight—the manner of its repeal carries a big
          object-lesson for the women voters who as yet are somewhat unpracticed
          in politics. It is rumored tha tthe big lighting corporations had much to
          do with the repeal of the act—the gas and electricity corporations, who find
          that the longer daylight cuts largely into the consumption of gas and electric light. But it is not necessary to credit the repeal to these corporations
          directly, and ifthey used some of their large funds for the influencing of
          public opinion, they did it chiefly in a manner which was, so far as the
          Congressmen and Senators are concerned, entirely legitimate.
          Anyone who follows the Congressional Records must have observed
          that during the time that the daylight saving repeal bill was under consideration Congress was systematically and heavily bombarded with petitions. Petitions are constantly being sent to Senators and Congressmen.
          These petitions refer to every kind of subject over which Congress has
          any power. The petitions are influential with the Senators and Representatives in proportion as they come from organized bodies with strong
          voting power. Petitions are almost negligible, however numerous they
          may be, when the petitioners have no votes. They are almost as negligible
          even if the petitioners are voters if they come from individuals without
          organizations behind them.
          But the petitions against daylight saving suffered from neither of these
          causes of weakness. They were mostly from the many local branches and
          pomonas of the Grange. The Grange is a great widespread organization
          not political in its character, but organized for the benefit of the farmers
          and their wives and sons and daughters —to benefit them both socially and
          in the carrying on of their affairs. Petitions from Granges have therefore
          both the advantages already alluded to—they are from great and powerful
          organizations largely composed of voters.
          The petitions from the Granges had the further weight in that they
          were from an organization whose members could not be safely counted
          upon by either the Republicans or the Democrats. The organization,
          moreover, has the reputation of having a greater hold on the affections and
          loyalty of the farmers in very many parts of the country than either of the
          great political parties. In other words, it is quite conceivable that if either
          political party went strongly against any policy advocted by the Granges,
          the Grange-members would show their organized displeasure by voting
          against its candidates.
          Senators and Representatives, day after day, were in receipt of these
          petitions from the Granges. How it came about that there was such a magnificently organized drive against daylight saving is a question that deserves some attention. But it is extremely unlikely that the Granges were
          conscious of any insidious influence whatever. The farmers honestly disliked the change of summer time, and when it was suggested to them that
          they pass a resolution against it and send the resolution to their Senators
          and Representatives they were perfectly willing and even eager to do so.
          Whether in all these many cases they would have passed the resolution
          without some outside suggestion may be a question. But the resolutions
          were genuine, and the expression of the farmers’ feelings was truly expressed in them.
          What the farmers accomplished will be easy of achievement by the
          women as soon as they come into possession of the vote. We have had the
          experience of seeing the Senators and Representatives so impressed by
          these petitions from an organization of voters —non-partisan in character.
          We have seen that the impression was so deep that Congress not only
          passed the repeal bill and sent it to the President, but repassed it by more
          than a two-thirds majority over the President’s veto, in spite of the fact
          that any cursory examination of conditions might convince an observer
          that fully half the population, if not more, were in favor of the new arrangement. Organization, votes and a possibility of using those votes in a
          non-partisan manner in order to obtain legislation for which there is a
          special demand —these are the forces that brought about the repeal of the
          daylight saving law, and they are forces which will soon be within the
          power of the women.</text>

        <text>GOOD BYE TO DAYLIGHT SAVING 
          The people of America can
          say goodbye to daylight saving
          next Sunday morning at 2 a. m.
          for at that hour the clocks of
          the country will be set back to
          the regular time and so far as
          the United States is concerned
          it is goodbye to daylight saving
          for all time to come.
          Some time ago Congrss passed
          a bill doing away with the law
          and the President vetoed the
          bill but it was finally passed
          again over the president' s veto.
            &The farmers of the country
            insisted that the daylight saving
            law worked a hardship to
            them and because of their
            demands for a repeal of the law
            it was finally repealed, but not
            however, until there was a big
            scrap over the measure.
            There are many adherants for
            daylight saving and as many
            opposed to the measure. Set back
            your clocks Sunday morning,
            Oct. 26th, at 2a. m. or before
            you go to bed on Saturday night.
            Turn the hands back one hour
            and say goodbye to daylight
            saving forever.

          Party Proposed
          CHICAGO. May 23.—Prospects of a

          agriculturists and ti*e exhibitors
          might join hands in a fight against
          daylight saving laws, were suggested
          by speakers today at the convention
          of the Motion Picture Theater Owners
          of America.
          “Daylight saving is no economy for
          moving picture theater owners.” one
          delegate said. “Its4nds the golfer to
          the links, the fisherman to the
          stream, the gardner to his back yard, and multitudes of mothers to tho
          front porch with their sewing, when,
          without so much day light after supper, all these people would be glad to consider the
          movie.”</text>

          be cnt by M. de Lesseps and bis present com
          pany. Those who' still believe that because M
          de Lasseps finished the Suez Canal, therefore
          he must, m spite of all appearances, finish tbe
          Panama Canal, forget the dominant facts of
          the situation. Tbe money subscribed, which
          has been really about 55,000,000, though the
          nominal sum advanced has been nearer
          75.000,000, has all been expended, and
          until tbe canal is completely finished,
          and for heavy ships, that enormous sum, ex
          ceeding the capital of 50 first-class banks, is
          all unproductive money, yielding no more than
          if it had been literally buried in the swamps of
          tbeChagres. To finish the canal will take, by
          the best calculations, forty millions sterling
          more. That has all along been the view of the
          American engineers; it was the view of the
          engineer specially selected by the French Gov
          ernment; and it is not really at variance with
          the sanguine calculations of M. de Lesseps him
          self, who has always wished to wise thirty
          millions more to finish the waterway and send
          a ship through, feeling satisfied that this once
          done, any remaining millions required
          for harbors, fortresses, dikes, light-houses,
          eta, would be easily forthcoming.
          Now, whence is that forty millions to be pro
          cured? The popular Idea in this country is
          that, under one device or another, the French
          Government will guarantee successive sums
          sufficient to complete the work; but that idea
          may prove wholly unfounded. The difficulties
          in the way are enormous. In tbe first place,
          tbe Government would only do this to secure
          votes, and it is by no means sure hat votes
          would be secured. Even those who favor this
          plan acknowledge that interest must be sus
          pended until tbe canal is complete, and the
          suspension of interest, say for five years, will
          cause neatly as much irritation as a liquidation
          on lavoraDle terms a liquidation wnicn. as we
          shall show, is by no means cast hoping for.
          Moreover, there are millions of shareholders in
          other concerns than the Panama canal, and
          every one of these will feel that bis
          claim to equality with his neighbor bas been
          impaired by the State preference shown to his
          rival! Then there is much reason to believe
          that the Government and the Chamber are not
          free to give such a guarantee. There has al
          ways been a definite understanding between
          the American and tbe French Governments
          about tbe canal: its basis, as settled in 1880,
          being tbat the canal shall never become, direct
          ly or indirectly, a Government undertaking.
          That would be a breach of the Monroe doctrine.
          If, therefore, the Chamber votes a guarantee to
          the undertaking, even in the form of an au
          thorization to the Credit Fonder, whose Presi
          dent is a State nominee, to issue a new Panama
          loan, the Government of Washington may in
          tervene, a risk which no rencn politician in
          the present statarof Europe will run for one
          moment. A quarrel with America would para
          lyze France for a time as a European power.
          Tbat this risk is serious, is evident from tbe as
          surances given by American statesmen to Gen
          eral Boulanger when he was in .New York, and
          by him reported as matters of the highest po
          litical urgency to bis Government In Paris.
          There remains the enthusiasm of the French
          peasantry forM. d Lesseps and for their In
          vestments; but bow far will that enthusiasm
          go? Not one incb, we should say, without Gov
          ernment intervention. It has already failed to
          fill the tempting Lottery Loan, and this, re
          .member, before the Interest at 6 per cent was
          stopped. We do not beliovo that 5,000,000
          could be extracted from the peasants by any
          scheme of priority bonds whatever. Tbe
          French city editors and scribes write magnilo-
          Suent nonsense about tbe grand personality of
          I. de Lesseps, and its influence on tbe millions;
          but the influence of a grand personality who
          offers hope and 5 per cent, and of the same per
          sonality when offering hope only, are two very
          different things. The French peasantry are in
          the aggregate very rich, tbey are patriotic, and
          they are grateful to M. de Lesseps for making
          their Suez Canal shares pay; hut they are not
          the kind of persons who, just when they are
          cruelly hard hit. Invest 50 per man there are
          870,000 shareholders and bondholders on bonds
          to become profitable some yeais bence. They
          will worship M. de Lessens to bny extent, bnt
          they will prefer bonds in the Suez Canal.We believe all these Ideas ate illusory, and
          that M. de Lesseps and his shavholders have,
          in the long run, just two alternatives before
          them. They can struggle on for a year or two
          through a slow sale of priority, bonds, keeping
          the works half alive, but hardly advancing the
          canal, till some occurrence, probably the great
          war, compels them to suspend operations, and
          admit that they are face to face with failure;
          or they can sell their concession and their works
          to Americans for a sum down, and a right to
          some rate of interest when the works succeed.
          Tbe Americans can and will bay them out, for
          they are so interested in the matter that they
          are proposing to spend twenty millions npon a
          rival and inferior canal through Nicaragua.
          Thoy would much rather have possession of
          tne ranama canal, ana so own tne sole key
          of their own house, tbe defensible water
          way upon which the future prosperity of their
          grand Pacific provinces will mainly depend.
          The purchaser may even be the Government of
          tho Union. That Government, oppressed with
          its wealth, would be pleased to see its surplus
          appropriated for five y ears,and content to draw
          on the money invested an average 3 per cent.
          Its security must always be perfect, for no
          European power will fire on tbe American flag,
          and if it never recovered a shillingin dividends,
          the mere increase of salable value in land and
          mines within the Pacific States consequent on
          tbe newroutewould bd'an ample compensation
          for tbe entire outlay. There is no constitutional
          difficulty in the way, for a treaty overrides the
          constitution, and the Union bought with money
          the grand French Dominion of Louisiana, then
          mnch larger tbau the present State of tbat
          name,
          As for engineers, the Washington Cabiuet
          bas the pick of tbe ablest in the world, and as
          for labor, it would only be too delighted if the
          1,600,000 of able-bodied negroes would all fake
          a dollar a day to work in tbe swamps
          on the Panama Canal. The Americans would
          finish tho canal In five years, if it Is in human
          power to do it, and no engineer has yet denied
          its possibility. That America, either through
          her Government or her mammoth capitalists,
          would leap at the chance, we have no doubt
          whatever; we have not patienca to discuss the
          Possible opposition of "Columbia:" and as to
          'ranco as a power, her patriotic vanity is
          always mixed up with a patriotic interestcd
          ness. General Boulanger and M. Ferry are
          both patriots of the exaggerative kind, and
          General Boulanger says openly that, while he
          would finish the canal, the Americans must
          have it; while M. Ferry acknowledged that he
          conquered Tonquin "to find berths for honest
          people." Tbe French people will be only too
          delighted to save so much of their hnarded
          money, while French statesmen know well
          that, except as a profitable speculation, Franco
          bas no interest in tbe canal.
          What is it to her? She has not a foot of soil
          which will be affected by its completion or its
          failure. Her trade with Asia will go through
          the canal, whatever the flag upon the fortresses
          at its outlets. She has no reason whatever to
          go on cutting the canal except the hope of
          profit and a sentiment of grandeur. Tho hope
          of profit is gone, and in matters of business a
          sentimental Frenchman is not only business-
          iiKe, Dumcis cara, aim nas, in particular, an
          ingrained prejudice against bankruptcy which
          we wish all Englishmen shared. There will be,
          no doubt, a moment of pain, and possibly nn
          explosion of verbal anger, and then tbe ma
          jority of Frenchmen will admit that a canal
          across Panama is and must be the business of
          the "United States "that great rival of perfidi
          ous Albion whose freedom we secured?' and
          sit-down to count the money saved out of
          the fire, and to ask what tho next grand enter
          prise will be. As to England, England will be
          at least as safe with America as nith Franco,
          and bas always this one source of consolation
          Ipr her abstinence from interference whoever
          cuts the canal, or manages or owns it, 80 per
          cent of all the tonnage passing through it will
          be under tbe British flag.</text>

          I Work Besumed in 1895
          It is not generally known that work
          on the Panama Canal was resumed in
          18S5 and has been continued almost or
          quite to this day In order to save some
          of the J2C0C000O0 de Lesseps company
          spent and to retain the valuable con
          cessions granted it the receivers of the

          was purchased by the directors of tho
          original compan who hoped b further
          subscription to save part of their original
          Investments Thirteen millions of dollars
          was all however they were willing to
          Invest and this only eleven days before
          the expiration of the original concession
          An extension of the time limit for com
          pletion to 1S10 was secured
          Made Every Dollar Tell
          The new company did not waste the

          but in contrast to its predecessors mado
          every dollar tell In the hope of retriev
          ing lost confidence or falling to secure

          the establishment of a communication by
          ship canal between the Atlantic and the
          Pacific oceans signed in 1S30 was it
          will be remembered the cause of some
          terrible suggestions in Congress It was
          a leng tedious task to get Great Britain
          to substitute the Hay Pauncefote treaty
          for that declaration by the governments
          of the United States and Great Britain
          that neither one nor the other will ever
          obtain or maintain for itself any exclusive
          control over the said ship canal War
          was several times last year suggested
          but President Roosevelts first message
          bore the tidings I am glad to be able to
          announce to jou that our negotiations on
          this subject with Great Britain have re

          matter now stands in Congress the Hep
          burn bill providing for the building of
          the canal by the Nicaragua route has
          passed the House while the Senate Com

          to 4 to favorably report the measure in

          Wonderful Engineering Feat
          The plan of the Nicaragua Canal com
          prises an engineering feat of the most
          wonderful kind ever attempted In the
          Isthmian Commissions estimate of the
          time it will take to construct the ca
          nal six j ears arc given to the construc
          tion of the dam across the San Juan
          Itlver while but two more will serve to
          Tkpict at Termtkl BaisT AMa IRR
          complete the waterway The San Juan
          leaves the southeast corner of Lake Nic
          aragua and flows almost east into the Ca
          ribbean Sea The first half of its length
          from the lake is one succession of rapids
          and waterfalls It is then joined by the
          Rio San Carlos and its size doubled Two
          miles above this juncture is the site for
          the great dam
          San Juans Flow
          The San Juan in its normal state has
          a flow of 20000 cubic feet per second but
          in the rainy season it sometimes amounts
          to 200000 To hold back this flood with
          a dam 150 feet high and thereby raise the
          waters of the riVer to the level of the
          lake is the project This is the great
          work on the NIcaraguan route The other
          dams and thocuts and embankments are

          General Opinion Incorrect
          It is the general opinion that there is
          quite a dJlference between the levels of
          tho two oceans Such however is not tla
          case Tho levels are about the same but

          REPUBLIC SPECIAL.
          Washington, June !. After a contest
          that will be historic, the Senate to-day
          passed Senator Spooner's substitute for the
          Hepburn canal bill, providing for the con
          struction of an Isthmian canal. It Is a bill
          in the Interest of the Panama Canal Com
          pany only so far as It provides that the
          President shall authorize the construction
          of a canal via Panama If he can get a
          clear title and acquire the Panama property
          for $40,000,000.
          If he cannot acquire the Panama property
          and get clear title, then he Is to authorize
          tho construction of a cannat via. lake
          Nicaragua.
          The vote was not quite so close as was
          expected, because, when It became appar
          ent that the Spooner amendment would
          win by a small margin, three or four Sena
          tors flopped over.
          The real test vote came on substituting
          the Spooner bill, which was ayes 42, nays
          34, a majority of eight.
          SENATOR MORGAN SAYS
          CANAL IS ASSURED.
          Senator Morgan, who for neatly thirty
          years has been lighting and working every
          day for a Nicaraguan canal, now says that
          the action of the Senate to-day. In his opin
          ion. Insures a canal across the isthmus. It
          was expected that he would take a very
          gloomy view and Insist, as he has been In
          sisting In the Senate, that the passage o
          the Spooner bill would mean no canal at alL
          On the contrary, he Is satisfied that the
          outlook Is encouraging, and believes a canal
          by way of Panama will be speedily con
          structed. Interest, of course, at once shifts to the
          House. It 1b expected that Representative
          Hepburn, chairman of the Committee on
          Interstate and Foreign Commerce, will fight
          the Spooner amendment, but practically all
          the leaders there are In favor of accepting
          It rather than even the risk of going before
          the people at the fall elections with no
          legislation at all.
          Speaker Henderson and Representatives
          Payne, Cannon and Grosvenor. are all In
          favor of accepting the Spooner bill. Indeed,
          there Is little doubt that the Spooner billHow much In earnest the Senate was Is
          shown by the fact that It adopted as an
          amendment to the Spooner bill elaborate
          provisions, offered by Senator Bacon, pro
          viding for the appointment of a commission
          that shall have charge of construction, and
          also adopted an amendment, offered by
          Senator Fairbanks, which Is a provision au
          thorizing the Issuance of $130,000,000 of bonds,
          to be taken by popular subscription, which
          are to run for ten years.
          As a further Illustration that It Intends
          to sta. J or fall by the Spooner bill, the
          Senate went through the fiction of Insist
          ing upon its amendment to the House canal
          legislation, and appointed a committee to
          confer with tho House Senators Morgan,
          Hanna and KIttrcdge.
          These three Senators, It Is expected, will
          stand together because Senators Hanna and
          Klttredge are enthusiastic supporters of the
          Spooner bill, and Senator Morgnn has ac
          quiesced In the day's work of the Senate.
          The bond Issue of $130,000,000 voted by the
          Senate will fall $31,000,000 short of paying
          the entire cost of the Panama CanaL The
          cost of constructing the Panama canal, as
          estimated by the commission of which Rear
          Admiral Wallter was chairman. Is $141.23$,
          3.'5. as against the cost at Nicaragua of
          J1S9.SS4.0C3.
          But to the cost of Panama must be added
          the J40.0CO.000 that is to be paid to the Pan
          ama Canal Company for Its rUhts. property
          and franchises, bringing the cost to $IS4,-
          C0O.0O0.

          From statistics gathered by him from

          there have been an average of 2018 persons employed by the French company
          Among these there have been only two
          cases of yellow fever during that time

          "A Street Scene in Cnlebra" shows two men
          belonging to the garbage department of the
          Sanitary Commission carrying a box of refuse.
          Open drains under the houses and along the
          Bides of the street are apparent The untidy
          look of the street is due to loose stories.

          Part of Last Month.
          The Tril.une presents to-day for the instruction and entertainment of its readers a series
          •f photographs made in the Panama Canal
          •one in the early part of last month by C. L
          Chester, a photographer who was sent there by
          '
          the firm of Underwood Underwood, of this
          '
          \u25a0tfity, to make pictures for other purposes than
          acwßjiaper illustration and who knew nothing at
          all wh-n he made them of the brief but
          Cow notorious visit of Poultney Bigelow, which
          veo nil\ resulted in so much amusement. Mr.
          BigeJow visited the isthmus last November, and
          on returning' home made most positive and
          grave charges against the sanitary administration there. These charges at first were
          received
          by the public with some consideration, but when
          the Secretary of War showed from the records
          that the steamer which took this painstaking
          investigator to the isthmus landed him a: Colon
          at 10 a, m. on one day and bore him away again
          at 2 o'clock on the following afternoon, so that
          his personal investigation was confined to a
          period of twenty-eight hours, Including one
          night, a roar of laughter went up from the
          whole country.
          Mr. Chester, the photographer who took the
          pictures which The Tribune publishes to-day,
          did not make an "Investigation" for any political party or clique. He was sent there to
          photograph the physical conditions as he found
          them, and without comment or deduction.
          His pictore ;illed "Overlooking the Burned District of Colon" shows one of the modern
          tenement houses on the left and in the background
          a new government building incourse of erection.
          The street appears to be neat and clean, and
          two covered garbage cans show up prominently
          at the stre t lino.
          The photograph called "View of Broadway In
          Culebra" shows the main street of Culebra, in
          Panama Standing at the right is a canal zone
          policeman wearing a helmet. Large cans for
          garbage are conspicuous. The street appears
          to be well drained. Itis not littered with refuse
          of any kind.

          '.: tfjfected by the canal supply a definite
          /.\u25a0 basis for calculation.
          \u25a0i T Is conservatively estimated that the
          I canal will yield an Income of $100,
          *'•• 000,000 during the first 10 years of
          its operation. With the impetus which
          fhe canal will doubtless give to trade
          in this period alone it is believed that
          the income may even be at the rate
          of $16,000,000 a year or more. The cost
          \u25a0of building the canal has been various
          ly estimated; the most recent figure
          mentioned authoritatively has been a
          :maxlmum of $300,009,000. Speaking In
          round, numbers It seems reasonable to
          '^calculate a return of 3 per cent upon
          • \u25a0t;:is enormous expenditure in the first
          10 years of Its operation alone. In
          years to. come the profit may reason
          ably be estimated at considerably In
          excess of this figure.
          ".. The data upon which these estimates
          are based have been collected by Prof.
          .'.Emory R. Johnson of the first canal
          commission, who has made .a special
          study of the probable Income of the
          banal. His estimates are doubtless the
          .most reliable obtainable. The. toll for
          ships passing through the canal has
          not yet been definitely fixed, but it is
          .probable that it will be regulated at
          •$1 per vessel ton net. This figure may
          .vary slightly, but it is safe to assume
          .for a general calculation. It is also
          .assumed for • the purpose of such an
          .estimate that the first ship will pass
          •from sea to sea through th« canal on
          January 1. 1815.
          According to Professor Johnson's es
          timates there will be. by thy end of
          1914 some 6.598.773 tons of traffic
          whjch will use the canal passing: in
          both directions. The data upon which
          this estimate is made will be reviewed
          later. Now .counting the increase in
          traffic at 62 M per cent for the next
          JO years, which Is considered reason
          able, there will be by 1924, some
          11,372,941 tons.
          'Taking the gradual increase from
          year to year between 1915 and 1J24.
          it will be found that between 100.000.
          •OOO and 150.000.0u0 tons of traffic will
          clear the canal. This estimate is
          based upon the increase in the trade
          which would undoubtedly have : used
          the canal in the last 20 years had it
          been available.
          A fairly accurate estimate may be
          made In this way of the number of
          ships and the amount tonnage
          which will pass through as soon as it
          is thrown open. The exact figures de
          pend of course upon how rapidly our
          trade develops in the expanding mar
          kets of the western hemisphere and
          how long it will take to readjust the
          trade to lit new conditions which the
          canal will establish.
          -p-HE fixing of the toll rate Is one of
          I the roost serious problems before
          * the canal commission.* If the rate
          be too high It will be difficult to de
          flect trade from Its present courses.
          while If it be too low the income on
          this enormous Investment will of
          course suffer. It will come as a sur
          prise to most laymen in the matter to
          is considerably higher than can be
          charged at Panama.
          The charge for passing through the
          Suez canal is 8% franco ($1.70), or
          "nearly twice the probable charge at
          Panama. Incidentally, the traffic re
          ceipts of the Suez canal from 1870 to
          date amount to about $385,000,000. The
          receipts for 1870 were only .' $995,750,
          as against $7,689,214 in 1860. In 1890
          the receipts had risen to $12,927,912,
          and by rtOO they had grown to $17,
          490,356. A similar increase in the
          traffic and the income at Panama
          would obviously bring to the United
          States a most gratifying return upon
          its investment. Since 1900 the receipts
          of the Suez canal have increased at
          the rate of about $2,000,000 a year.
          From IS9I to 1901. Inclusive, the re
          ceipts were $174,786,109. In view, of .
          these figures the estimate of $100,
          000,000 income for the first 10 years
          ]earn t that the toll for the Sues canal
          of the Panama canal is obviously very
          \u25a0conservative. ; .V^
          In fixing the rate of toll at Panama
          elaborate calculations have been made
          as to the exact caving In tlmo and ex
          pense to the various trade routes by
          using the canal, it is not believed
          that the rate of $1 a ton will be ex
          cessive for the ships of any of the regu
          lar; routes. By passing through ; the

          for instance, a vessel would save from
          10 to 11 days. The cost of oper-itlng a
          ship at sea for this additional time. It
          is . estimated, would alv • balfiuce the'
          price paid for permission to pass
          through the canal.

          to deflect the present! enormous traffic

          • The enormous, trade 'between Europe
          and the orient which now goes the
          other way ' around tho world is. be
          sides, certain to be deflected in large
          .•neasure to the new route. It is raere
          .ly a question of geography. The Pan
          ama canal offers the shortest route be
          tween, the two points. Most .of the
          commerce of,: Europe and New Zealand
          will pass this way,' as well as that be
          tween Europe and the other islands of
          tho Pacific east of Australia. * .
          The attraction of the new route for
          all this commerce is certain to prove
          irresistible. It is not generally real
          ized.- for instance, that New Zealand
          will be 1.318 miles nearer Liverpool" by
          the Panama canal than 'by the Suez,
          and 2,222 miles nearer than by way of
          Good Hope. The distances from Liver
          pool to the most important groups of
          the South Pacific Islands north of New
          Zealand will be from 500 to 5,500 miles
          less by. way of Panama than by way of
          Suez. : The entrances and clearances of
          New Zealand's trad* with northwestern
          Europe, that } ls, France and countries
          farther north, amounted to 481,173
          tons net register, in 1899. and tha com
          merce of that part 7>f Europe with the
          otEer islands of the South Pacific east
          of Australia ; amounted ' to; 1 8 1,74 3 tons.
          Orthls" r total traffio^of.f632,92l-tons,
          probably not less .than 600,000 - might
          have \u25a0 advantageously used \u25a0 th* Panama
          canal, which amount could be add*d to
          the tonnage of the canal traffio origi
          nating and terminating in America.
          A great part Zi Eurcps's trada w*ta
          Australia and Japan will find tha Pan
          ama routs advantageous and will ulti
          mately be deflected from th* .present
          route. This traffic is enormous and will
          yield a considerable Income to tha oanal
          in years to come. 1 The distances be
          tween Great Britain and Sydney and
          Yokohama by the Sues and by tha Pan
          ama routes are about the same, but tha
          Panama route will have the advantage
          that vessels In going by America la
          either direction on their way b«twe«a
          Europe and Japan or Australia will
          pass many ports from whloh thar* Is
          heavy export tonnaga, thus making tiia
          new routs more profitable than th* old.
          IN estimating the amount of traffla
          which will be drawn to th* n*w
          rout* a very conservative propor
          tion has been counted on. It haa baea
          asumed that 10 per cent of tha vassal
          tonnage* of the Australian trada with
          the ports of northwestern Europe may
          be counted on. and at least 5 per cent
          of the tonnage between these ports
          \u25a0
          and Japan will bo drawn the sama way.
          Event this trifling percentage would
          total 316.222 tons. In all probability
          it would be several times this figure.
          To total this estimate, therefore, we
          have 4.047,852 tons, representing tha
          traffic beginning and terminating in
          America, plus the 500,000 tons of Euro,
          pean trade, plus 516.223 tons, or In all
          4,931.075 tons — in round numbers
          5.000,000 tons — which would have passed
          through the Panama canal In 1839. It
          is obvious that this estimate Is. if any
          thing, less than may reasonably b«
          expected.
          This tonnage is. of course, based
          upon figures 10 years old. and la by
          no means a fair estimate of tha traf
          fic between these same ports today.
          The statistics show that the tonnaga
          of vessels trafficking between the two
          coasts of the United States and be
          tween the eastern United States and
          the orient and between Europe and tha
          Pacific Is increasing rapidly from year
          to year. . Between 1839 and 1895 tha
          gain in tonnaga available for the canal
          was . 25.01 per cent, while from 1899
          to the present time the gain has been
          even more remarkable. The commerce
          between Chile and E«"rope increased
          from 575.890 tons in ISSS to 914,091
          tons in 1893. or a gain of 53.7 par cent,
          and this remarkable rise has certainly
          not disappeared since that data.
          THE estimate of 5,000,000 tons ol
          traffic available In 1899 is clearlj
          much too 10-w 'today. In *very
          branch of traffio the amount of ton
          nage that could advantageously use
          the canal has increased. With this rats
          of increase as a. guide It will be found
          that the available canal traffic in 1909
          will be 6.257,249 tons. By the closa of
          1914. or. about tha time of the proposed
          opening of the canal the available
          tonnage, estimated at the present rat*
          of increase, will be 7.000,000. By th*
          year 1924, at the same rate of increase,
          the estimates show a tonnag* of 11,
          372.941.
          It will be seen that the estimate of
          $100,000,000 Income for the first 10
          years of the canal is practically as
          sured. If any mistake has been made
          in this estimate the failure has been
          not to make the figures high enough.
          The calculations have not allowed for
          the Immense stimulus which the open
          ing of the canal is certain to glvs to
          trade on both seaboards of th* Amer
          ican continent.
          At present it is a matter of rexTst, al
          most of shame, that by far the greatest
          purt of the trade of South America goes
          directly to Europe. It is only a short
          time since it has been possible to sail
          from New York to South American
          ports without first going to Europe.
          With the opening: of the Panama canal
          the traffic between the east coast of tha
          United States and the western coa3t of
          South America, and again to mention
          only one route, is likely to be awakened
          to the great interest of both seaboards
          'and the profit ot the canal. The trade
          between the two seaboards of the t^**
          ed States again is likely to grow with
          leaps and bounds. An immense amount
          of \u25a0 the traffic which now crosses the
          continent by ralU will be deflected la
          large ' measure by way o( . the canal aa
          soon as tt lj poasloio io amp cargoes
          in unbroken packages. It is this trafllo
          which is expected to show the most
          rapid rateTof Increase, although the In
          come has not received proper considera
          tion In the estimate,
          The figures thus arrived at have to do
          - with the gross Income from the canal.
          Until tha work of construction has been
          further advanced and o»»ui» engineer
          ing problems have been worked out.
          especially. in connection wltlt tin b^HA-
          Ing of the great; locks, it la dlfflcult-t*
          estimate with any accuracy the possible
          cost lof maintenance.. During tho first
          decade of the canal operation, at least.
          It Is not anticipated that any consider
          able work* of repairing or new con
          struction-will have to be met. Infu
          ture years the greatly increased incoms
          of the canal will readily offset any ad
          • dltlonal expense. Since a conservative
          estimate of the income of the waterway
          may be placed at $130,000,000 for 10
          years, or at th« rate of i^i per cent.
          the estimate o* a return of 3 per cent

        <text>PROBING THE PANAMA CANAL PURCHASE
          Some Peculiar Facta Have Come to Light as a Result of Mr. Roosevelt's Recent
          Epistle So Many Suspicious Circumstances That Congress Must Investigate
          Mm. Roosevelt stirred up a hornet's nest
          with' his letter addressed to William Dudley
          Foullce-an- d attacking the editor of the Indianapolis News and the editor of the New York
          Sun.
          On the iirst day of the congressional session Representative .Henry T. Rainey oMllinois
          presented a1 resolution providing for the investigation of the Panama canal purchase. The
          resolution was referred to a house committee
          But the New York World, which was not
          assailed in the president's letter, takes a hand
          in the controversy. The following Associated
          Press dispatch tells the story:
          New York, December 8. The New York
          World, to which Delavan Smith, editor of the --
          Indianapolis News, referred in his reply to PresP
          dent Roosevelt's attack upon him, as the authority for the article on the Panama canal
          which appeared in his papers and called forth
          the president's letter says today:
          In view of President Roosevelt's deliherate
          misstatement of fact in hia scandalous personal
          attack upon Mr. Delavan Smith, editor of the
          Indianapolis News, the World calls upon the congress of the United States to make
          Immediately a
          all and impartial Investigation of the entire
          Faiikmai canal scandal.
          The investigation of 1906 by the senate
          committee or the inter-ocean-ic canals was
          blocked by the refusal of William Nelson Cromwell to answer the most pertmeat questions of
          Senator Morgan of Alabama. Since that time nothing has. been done because after Senator
          Morgan's death there was no successor to carry
          on his great work of revealing the truth about
          Panama, corruption.
          The Indianapolis News said in the editorial
          for which Mr. Roosevelt assails Mr. Smith:
          "It has been charged that the United States
          bought from American citizens for $40,000,000
          property that cost those cltfcaens only $12,000,-00- 0.
          There la no doubt that the government
          .paid $40,00 0,0.00 for the property. But who
          got the money?"
          President Roosevelt's reply to this most
          proper question is for the most part a string
          of abusive and defamatory eplthet3w But he
          also-- makes the following statements aa truthful
          information to the American peoples
          "The United States, did! not pay a; cent of
          the $40,00-0,00- 0
          to-- any American!" citizen. . The
          government paid the $4000 0,00 0; direct ta the
          French government, getting, the receipt of the
          liquidator appointed! by ther French, government
          to receive the samei. .
          "The. Unite States government has not
          theslishtest, knowledge as to--
          the particular fn--,
          iiYfduul&T among whom the French government
          distributed the same
          "So far as I know there was no syndicate;
          there certainly was ao syndicate In the United States that to my knowledge had any
          dealings
          with the government directly or Indirectly.'
          To the best of the World's knowledge and belief each and all,,of these statements made by
          Mr. Roosevelt and quoted above are untrue,
          and Mr. Roosevelt must have known they were
          untrue when he made them.
          ONUT ONE MAX KNOWS AUa
          As to the detailed distribution of the Panamas loot only one man knows It all. And that
          manv Is William Nelson Cromwell. The two men
          who ;were most in Mr. Cromwell's confidence
          axe Theodore Roosevelt, president of the United
          States, and Elihu Root, former secretary of war
          and now secretary of state. It was they who
          aided Mr. Cromwell In consummating: the Pan-aa- aa
          revolution, arranged the terms of the purchase of the Panama canal, made the agreement
          to pay $40,000,000 on the canal properties and
          an additional $10,000.000 for a manufactured
          Pasama. republic, every penny of both of which.
          sms was paid by check on the United States
          treasury to J. P. Morgan Jb Co. not to the
          French government, as Mr. Roosevelt says, but
          to J. P. Morgan & Co.
          The natural Query of the Indianapolis News
          as to "who got the money?" was based on the
          World's historical summary of Mr. Cromwell's
          connection with the Panama canal. The inqulrv
          iras originally the World's, and ttfe World accepts Mr. Roosevelt's challenge. If congress
          can
          M"l"Wi'
          have all the documents in the case let congress
          make a complete investigation of the Panama
          canal affair, and In particular of William Nelson
          Cromwell's relation with the Panama company,
          with Panama: and with the government of the
          United States. Let congress officially answer --
          this question. "Who got the money?"
          The old French company organized by
          Ferdinand de Lesseps in 1879 failed in 18 9 IK,,
          years before Mr. Cromwell's relations with President Roosevelt began. As Mr. Cromwell
          testified before the senate committee on February
          26, 1906: "We never had any connection with
          the so-call- ed De Lesseps company. Neither did
          'the United States government conduct negotiations with the old French Panama Canal
          company."
          THE CROMWEIiI CONTROL
          What Mr. Cromwell did represent was the
          new Panama canal company, the American Panama Canal company, and the $5,000,000 syndic
          cate which he formed to finance the new companies. After Mr. Cromwell had testified "I do
          not recall any contract,,' Senator Morgan produced a contract reading (Panama canal
          hearing, voL II., page 1X4 ff) :
          "Mr. William Nelson Cromwell is exclusively empowered under the formal agreement
          with the hoard of directors of the-- Compagnle
          Nouvelle du Canal de Panama: (new Panama-Cana- l
          company of France) r
          to effect with, ait American syndicate the Americanization of the
          Banama Canal company on the following basis."
          The basis om whlchi Mr; Cromwell was "exclusively empowered" In this contract was that
          an American Panama Canal company with: a.
          capitalization of $0,000,000 preferred "and
          $45.,0QO,000 common should be organized to
          take over the Panama canal concessions and all
          other property belonging to the new French
          Panama. Canal company, which had bought the
          same from the old De Lesseps. company. This
          company was Incorporated in New Jersey with
          dummy directors. There was also incorporated
          in New Jersey with dummy directors the Inter-Ocean-ic
          Canal company.
          Senator Morgan unearthed a copy of the
          $5,000,0001 syndicate agreement which, provided
          that the subscribers should! contract with William Nelson Cromwell to pay in $a,Q 00,000
          in
          cash, and toi take their several allotments in the
          enterprise.
          Five million dollars was more than ample
          to buy the majority of the old Panama stock.
          As the World said on October 2o:
          "Mr. Cromwell applied" to the canal situation the methods of American high finance by
          t
          which a. syndicate takes over the property of a
          bankrupt concern, then creates a. holding company and a. recapitalization,, keeping the
          ma- jority control In a syndicate trusteeship.'
          Following that, to quote from Mr. Cromwell's testimony,. "In Mayr 1904, I, representing
          the new Panama canal, and Judges Day and Russell, representing Attorney General TTnox,
          consummated the transfer and sale to the United States."
          ROOSEVELT'S MISTAKE
          Mr. Roosevelt says, "the government paid this 540,000,000 direct to the French
          government."'
          Mr. Cromwell testified that the United States' paid the money to J. P. Morgan & Co.
          Mr. Roosevelt says; "the Frendi government distributed, the sum."
          Mr. Cromwell testified as to how he "distributed it.
          Mr. Roosevelt talks of "getting the receipt or the liquidator appointed by the French
          government to receive the same."--
          Mr. Cromwell testified: "Of the $40 000 --
          000 thus paid by the1 United States government $23,000,000 was paid to the liquidator of
          the old Panama canal company under and in pursuance of an agreement entered Into between
          the liquidator and the new company. Of the balance of $13,000,000 paid to the new Panama:
          Canal company $12,000,000 has already been distributed among Its stockholders and the re-
          mainder is now being' held awaiting- -
          final dis- tribution and payment.'
          hH..ut4..tfl-iWhat follows is further eloquent testimony
          taken by the senate committee:
          "Senator Taliaferro There Is $3,000,000?"
          "Mr. CromwelT Three millions, yes, sir."
          "Senator r Taliaferro Who holds that
          money?"
          "Mr. Cromwell The new Panama Canal
          company In its treasury."
          And yet Mr. Roosevelt says that "the
          United States government has not the slightest
          knowledge" as to the distribution of the $40,-000,0- 00
          and that "this was the business of the
          French government."
          As to Mr. .Roosevelt's statement that "there
          was no syndicate," he could have read the
          "syndicate subscription agreement" on page
          1150, volume DT of the testimony before the
          committee on Inter-ocean-ic canals if he had
          cared for the truth.
          That the United States government was not
          dealing with "the French government," or "the
          liquidator appointed by the French government,"
          or with Colombia, or with Panama, or with any
          one else except William Nelson Cromwell and
          his associates, is made still more plain by the
          description of Senor J. Gabriel Duque as to the
          Panama revolution and as to the manner in
          which Mr. Cromwell got $10,000,000- - additional
          from the United States treasury, Senor Duque
          said:
          HOW REVOLUTION WAS MADE
          "Mr. Cromwell made the revolution. He
          offered to make me president of the new republic
          and to see me through If I would raise a small
          force of men and declare a secession from Colombia. He made promises that we should have
          the help of his government. It was accompanied
          by a liberal use of money. We bought this
          general and that one, paying $3,000 to ?4,000
          per general. The Colombian officers were all
          paid off and the Colombian general who was sent
          to stop the revolution was also bought off."
          Then Mr. CromwelL, having been elected
          by the Panama republic as general counsel, and
          he and J. Plerpont Morgan having been appointed a "fiscal commission," negotiated with
          President Roosevelt by which the United States paid
          $10,000,000 more to "the fiscal commission"
          for Mr. Cromwell's. Panama republic. Of this
          money three-quarte- rs is still under the control
          of "the fiscal commission..'
          Why did the United States pay $40,OQf ,000
          for a bankrupt property whose control could undoubtedly have been bought In the open
          markec
          for less, than" $4,0 00,000?
          Who were the Panama Canal company?
          Who bought up the obligations of the oil
          Panama Canal company for a, few cents on
          the dollar?
          Among whom was divided the $15,000.
          0C0
          paid to the new Panama Canal company?
          Whether Douglas Robinson, who is Mr.
          Roosevelt s brother-in-la- w, or any of Mr. Taft
          s
          brothers, associated himself with Mr. Cromwell
          in Panama exploitation or shared in these profits
          is Incidental to the main issue of letting in
          light. ..
          Whether they did or did not, whether all
          the profits went into Mr. Nelson Cromwell
          s
          hands, or whatever became of them, the fact
          that Theodore Roosevelt, as president of the
          United States, issues a public statement abcat
          such an important matter full of flagrant
          untruths, reeking: with misstatements-- , challenging
          line by line the testimony of his associate, Cromwell, and the official record, makes It
          imperative that full publicity come at once throagn
          the authority and by the action of congress.</text>

        <text>THE STORY OF THE GREAT PANAMA CANAL
          BY THE MAN WHO BUILT IT!
          The Most Important Newspaper Article of the Year
          Written for the Readers of The Day Book by
          That Great American, Colonel George
          W. Goethals, U. S. A.
          The story of the greatest work
          done by man's-han- on this earth's
          surface is told by this modest soldier, this greatest of engineers, in
          words so simple, direct and clear that
          any school child can understand it.
          He tells the story from the beginning up to today, explaining itu
          problems and describing its features
          not with dry details and tiresome
          figures, but so plainly that the readev
          sees the canal in his mind's eye, just
          as it stands on the isthmus ready for
          ships to pass through.
          No article you have ever read has
          told you so lucidly and interestingly
          about the great locks of the canal
          and what they will do, as will Col.
          Goethals in his story.
          Is the lock canal better than a
          sea level canal? The colonel absolutely settles that point.
          Col. Goethals writes how Uncle
          Sam became boss of a great grocery
          and meat department store.
          What about the great landslides?
          Col. Goethals explains them so that
          all can understand them.
          Can the Panama canal be blown
          up? The colonel gives his idea of
          that, also.
          Finally he will tell you just how
          Uncle Sam's men on the Job DID the
          world's greatest jot) just how the
          plans were successfully carried out.
          You have read lots of "stuff" about
          the canal. For "stuff" and much nonsense have been written about it.
          But the story by Col. Goethals gives
          you the real goods, ALL OF IT, from
          first to last. Whole books will be
          written about this wonderful American enterprise, but NONE will tell
          more about the Panama Canal than
          Col. Goethals in this article he has
          written EXPRESSLY FOR YOU.

        <text>THE STORY OF THE GREAT PANAMA CANAL
          BY THE MAN WHO BUILT IT!
          The Day Book is proud today to present to its readers the first part of
          "The Story of the Panama Canal," written by Col. George W. Goethals, the
          man who built the canal that most stupendous piece of human handiwork
          in the world's history. This is the first article Col. Goethals has written
          since he took charge in Panama a half dozen years ago. Although often
          importuned by magazines and newspapers, he would not put his pen to
          paper until his job was completed or practically completed. The Day Book
          wishes to announce that it has secured exclusive rights of publication of
          this important article in this city.
          In "Part I," which we print today, Col. Goethals gives an outline of the
          kind of canal proposed to be built and some idea of the objections to it that
          were first raised, as well as the enormous difficulties that had to be met and
          overcome in the building. He starts his story from the enactment of the
          first Panama legislation by the United States Congress. In very brief form
          he tells of the discussion of the sea level and lock types which raged throughout the country. Col. Goethals' story is a plain, simple tale of a wondeful
          achievement. The language is direct as are his methods. It can be understood as well by the school child as by the teacher who reads it to him.

          PART I.
          BY COL. GEORGE WASHINGTON GOETHALS, " ' '
          Corps of Engineers, United States Army, Chairman and Chief Engineer,
          Isthmian Canal Commission.
          (Copyright, 1913, by the Newspaper Enterprise Association in the United
          States, Great Britain, France and Germany.)
          It is not possible in the time at my
          disposal to enter upon a description
          of the explorations and investigations
          which were made of the various
          routes proposed for a canal joining
          the two oceans, nor can any account
          be taken of the consideration which
          resulted in the United States finally
          adopting the Panama route. Suffice
          it to say that under the. Spooner act,
          approved June 28, 1902, the president of the United States secured the
          necessary concession from the republic of Panama, purchased the
          rights and property of the French
          New Panama Canal Co. and undertook the construction of the canal
          May 4, 1904.
          The Isthmus of Panama runs nearly east and west, and the canal
          traverses it from Colon on the north
          to Panama on the south, in a general
          direction from northwest to southeast, the Pacific terminal being 22
          miles east of the Atlantic entrance.
          The greatest difficulty of the Panama route was the control or disposition of the Chagres river and its tributaries. The canal which the president was authorized to construct by
          the provisions of the Spooner act
          was the lock type recommended by
          the first isthmian canal commission
          in its report submitted Nov. 16, 1901.
          This plan provided a lake for controlling the Chagres, following along
          the plans of the New Panama Canal
          Co., thereby utilizing to the fullest extent the work already accomplished.
          Early in the progress of the work
          the construction of a sea level canal
          was agitated; this is undoubtedly the
          ideal canal. It took such a hold on
          the public mind that, in consideration,
          of the international importance of-th-e
          work the president convened a
          board of consulting engineers to consider and report upon the type of</text>

          Present high railroad rates are largely
          made necessary by the loss of revenue
          freight which now goes through the Panama canAl. The coast interest# are sendIng out propaganda of a subtle character
          for the purpose of diverting attention
          from the real iesue.
          Because of the fact that thin Issue will
          eome up for consideration in congress,
          The Omaha Bee has arranged for the
          publication of the facts as seen by mlddleuestern industrial and business in*
          tercet*. The following article !• the first
          of a series by Will M. Manpfn.
          ARTICLE I.
          By WILL M. MAUPIN.
          Propaganda is beginning to
          appear, fathered by the great
          industrial interests of the Atlantic and Pacific seaboards
          and the coastwise shipping interests, the purpose of which
          is the perpetuation of the
          present toll and carriage
          rates through the Panama
          canal.
          The interstate commerce
          commission, created in 1887,
          was given charge of the matter of regulation and rate
          making. This was before the
          Panama canal was more than
          the exploded dream of a
          Frenchman, and therefore
          before canal traffic was even
          considered more than a remote possibility.
          Section IV of the Interstate commerce act has long been the center of
          agitation and argument. Thl» la
          popularly known as the "long and
          ahort haul” clause, the effect of which
          In general la to deny to the railroads
          the right to make a lower rate from
          coast to coast than the rate to Intermediate polnta. But the act waa so
          framed as to give the commission the
          right to make a lower rate for the
          long haul than the short haul upon
          a showing that the lower rate for a
          long haul was necessary la order to
          compete with a shorter haul between
          the earns polnta. Under this ruling
          numerous permissions were secured
          by railroads to make lower rates between widely separated points than
          the total of two short hauls between
          the same points.
          The present fight upon Section IV,
          construed as It has been by the Interstate commerce commission, Is not
          being made by the railroads. Senator Gooding of Idaho has Introduced
          a bill, the purpose of which is to
          amend Section IV so as to prohibtt
          the commission from exercising discretion and compelling a rigid enforcement of the section.
          Conditions art Changed.
          Present conditions are so radically
          different from old conditions under
          which abuses crept In under discriminations by long and short haul manipulation, that It Is necessary to
          hava a proper understanding thereof
          ns a condition precedent to a proper
          understanding of the present controversy ■x'' ✓
          Panama canal rate* are aoing exactly the aame thing today that the
          old long haul rate* once did—they are
          building up the Industrie# on the
          coasts at the expenie of th# Industrial development of th# Interior. Incidentally the railroads, which are
          and always will be the backbone of Interior transportation, are losing millions of dollars to this low water rate
          competition. There can be but one
          result to the Interior sections, th#
          Omaha territory for example. They
          fUce the possibility of further Increase In freight rates If the Gooding
          amendment prevails and the railroads
          are thus deprived of the revenue#
          they now get from the long haul
          rate# permitted by th* Interstate commerce commission. Deprived of this
          long haul revenue the railroads must
          somehow make up the deficit, If they
          are to continue to function. With
          the long and ahort haul clause rigidly enforced, without flexibility, the
          waterway through the Panama canal,
          between the two ocean# Immediately
          will begin carrying practically all of
          the transcontinental freight. This
          will tend to undermine Industry In
          th* Interior sections and concentrate
          practically all of It upon th* two
          coasts.
          Campaign of Propaganda.
          That a campaign of propaganda 1*
          under way to stir up prejudice
          agalnat th# railroads and at the same
          time to bolster up coast Industrie* by
          making It appear that the railroads
          are making a concerted attack upon
          the Panama canal, la plain to even
          the superficial observer.
          It Is not trus that th# railroad*
          are nttacklng the Panama canal. On
          the contrary the railroad* *r# on the
          defensive. They are merely asking

          mlddleweetern business man feel*
          that It ehould—bring about a mo\t
          ment In congress that would regulate
          Panama Canal ratea rather than disturb present adjustments. In an effort to defeat this outcome and to
          protect the coast to coast monopoly
          through low water borne rates, the
          propaganda of discrediting the rail
          roads and holding up the Panama
          canal as sacred, ha» begun.
          Because the railroads are asking
          for a chance to compete with the
          Panama canal route, and because
          they oppose Senator Gooding s
          amendment, they are charged with a
          conspiracy to close the canal to
          freight traffic and make of It
          "merely a part of the national defense.’’ It Is further charged that
          this la but following out the longcontinued policy of the railroads
          _
          to
          throttle water competition and prevent the development'of Interior waterways. This Is a string that has
          been harped upon for years.
          A writer of somewhat more than
          national repute is now putting forth
          a series of articles in which he seeks
          to show that the railroads of the
          United States have so conspired that
          the peopte are deprived of distribution facilities that have been highly
          developed in continental Europe. No
          on# acquainted with the facts will
          deny that waterway transportation
          in Europe hee been highly developed,
          nor that water transportation cuts a
          great figure over there In the piatter
          of rates. But those who emphasize
          waterway development in Europe fail
          utterly to take Into account—or at
          least to acknowledge—the tremendous
          difference between conditions there
          and conditions here. Wherever population Is dense enough to make
          water transportation profitable In the
          United States, it exists, But as a
          general proposition rail transportation Is so much cheaper and the service so much quicker and better, that
          water transportation has languished
          because unprofitable.
          In considering the Panama canal
          it is only just and fair that a number of things be taken Into consideration when comparing rates by rail
          and rates by canal. Of course, it is
          cheaper to carry freight in vessels
          from one coast to the other, via the
          canal, than it is to carry it by rail
          between the two coasts. There is no
          coSt of maintenance for the waterway. The ocean Is there, has always
          heen there, and will always be there.
          It costs nothing to maintain the
          ocean. The only cost of maintenance
          on the entire route is along the few
          miles of the Panama canal. And it
          should be remembered that the government In addition to owning the
          canal also owns a railroad alongside
          to provide Itself with quick service
          and communication. On the coast to
          coast waterway. Including the Panama canal, the annual maintenance
          cost is less than the tie replacement
          coet of the transcontinental railroads.
          There are no immense shops to maintain, no taxes to pay, no immediate
          territory to serve and develop, and
          no restriction! a* are Imposed by law
          upon the rail carriers. The waterway payroll le infinitesimal in proportion to tons carried, when compared
          with the rail carriers.
          Nor ha# the writer now cnargms
          the railroad* with conspiracy to close
          ths canal taken Into account the discrimination In favor of the coastwise
          and coast-to-coast water traffic and
          against the business' houses and Industries In the Interior whose traffic
          Is carried by the railroads. The law
          makes coastwise traffic a monopoly by
          refusing to allow vessels other than
          those of American registry to engage
          in coastwise traffic. At the same time
          the Panama canal la closed to railroad steamship lines, even though
          they be American railroads using
          American-built vessels and carrying
          American crews. Illustrative of this
          the Southern Pacific. In an effort to
          compete with the canal, has equipped
          steamships to carry freight cargoes
          from New York to New Orleans and
          Houston, there trana shipping to their
          rail* and thence on to the Pacific
          roast. Similar shipments are made
          hy rail from the Pacific coast to Houston and New Orleans, and then by
          boat tp New York. This useless
          trana shipment la compulsory because
          the Southern Pacific la not allowed
          to aend It* freight vessels through
          t the Panama canal. The law permits
          privately owned vessel* to carry
          freight through the canal and make
          rates, without any supervision or
          regulation whatsoever. The rates
          which theae shipping Interest* charge
          would ruin th* railroad* If thay were
          compelled to make rate* to f meet
          them, and at th* earn* time had to
          charge proportionate rates for the
          haul at Intermediate points.
          Water rates from the Pacific to the
          Atlantic coast, and vice versa, are
          made lower by the fact that there is
          no necessity for breaking bulk, no
          necessity for stops at scores of intermediate points, no necessity for the
          maintenance of expensive repair
          shops, no arbitrary oversight by government commissions, and no taxes to
          pay such aa the rail carriers must
          pay to every state, county, municipality and achool district they touchOcean traffic need not take Into account the needs of interior points,
          while carriers must constantly keep
          In mind the needs and requirements
          of thousands of communities, each
          with a different environment.
          The question boiled down, la, How
          may water rates and rail rate* be *0
          adjusted that one may not prosper at
          the expense of the other; *o that one
          section of the country may not pros
          per at the expense of other sections,
          and a proper balance its maintained
          so that th* whole country may be
          benefited at the leaet possible ex

        <text>PANAMA- CANAU HISTORY.
          In May, 1879, a so-called Interna
          tional Congress met In Paris andj-e-solved
          that It was feasible to build
          a sea level canal across the isthmus
          in Central America. In 1880 Ferdi
          nand De Lesseps, already famous for
          his connection with the Suez Canal,
          visited the Isthmus, and in 1881 act
          ual work in the way of surveys, etc.,
          was commenced by the French Pan
          ama Canal Co.
          The world is familiar with the ef
          forts of De Lesseps, which were Un
          doubtedly in good faith, but he was
          surrounded and impaired by corrupt
          financiers, politicians and newspaper
          men in Paris, with the result that it
          is estimated over $400,000,000 of
          French capital, chiefly the invest
          ments of the poorer classes, was
          Bunk in the shares of the old Pana
          ma Canal Co., more than half of
          which was spent in promotion ex
          penses in France in the way of com
          missions, feos, etc., while of -he mo
          ney spent upon the isthmus untold
          thousands wer inves'.o.l in high pric
          ed machinery of all kinds, much of
          which today lies rusting and rotting
          in the packing boxes in which it was
          forwarded to the isthmus from France
          never having been opened or of the
          slightest use, and having little if any
          value at all at the present time. In
          the crash and exposure which follow
          ed the failure of the old Canal Com
          pany, De Lesseps himself served a
          term in prison, and has since died a
          disappointed and broken hearted
          man.
          In 1894 the New Panama Canal
          Company was formed, which acquir
          ed all the rights and title of the old
          company upon the isthmus, since
          which time there has been a cons
          tant effort on its behalf to' 'sell 'the
          property to the United States govern
          ment. ' This effort was strongly and
          persistently opposed by ( two elements
          one an American company who
          sought to have adopted a route for
          the Nicaraugua Canal, while a sec
          ond element, popularly supposed to
          represent the transcontinental rail
          road interests of America, sought to
          prevent the construction of any canal
          whatever. Realizing the popularity
          of the ' canal idea, this railroad ele
          ment, it has been charged, divided
          its strength among the partisans of
          the Panama and Nicaraugua rights
          in order that neither route could win
          out, and: by so doing they did suc
          ceed in delaying a decision in favor
          of any route until 1903, and even af
          ter this government concluded a trea
          ty with the government of Colombia,
          by which that government was to be
          paid $10,000,000 for the canal privi
          leges, which treaty was duly ratified
          by the United States senate, it was,
          as it is openly charged in Washing
          ton, defeated when it came before the
          Colombian government for ratifica
          tion by the efforts of the American
          transcontinental lines.
          The secession of the state of Pana
          ma from Colombia, and its prompt
          negotiation and ratification of a trea
          ty with this government is all recent
          history, and the United States gov
          ernment has bought all the rights
          heretofore belonging to the New Pan
          ama Canal Co. for the sum of $40,
          000,000, which has been paid in cash.
          A Commission has been appointed by
          this government to carry through the
          work of constructing the canal, which
          it Is supposed will require about
          eight years' work and $200,000,000 to
          complete.
          The ' length of the Panama Canal
          is 47 miles including about three
          miles dredged in the Pacific to deep
          water. " Starting from Colon on the
          Atlantic co; st the canal for about 12
          miles is navigable, varying in depth
          from 16 to 29 feet. From there to the
          end of the 26th mile the excavation
          is about naif completed for the entire
          distance. A great amount of work
          has been done between the 28th and
          33rd mile. Beyond this Culebra is
          reached, which cut now has an aver
          age depth of 180 feet. From the 40th
          mile to tide-water the canal has been
          opened and has a depth of water va
          rying from 6 to 16 feet. From the
          42nd mile the average depth is 27
          feet. When completed the average
          width of the canal will be 150 feet
          at the bottom and 200 feet at the top
          wiih an average depth of 30 feet, ha
          ving four locks on each side of the
          divide, which it is possible at a later
          time" to dispense "with.
          As illustrating the great changes
          which the completion of this gigan
          tic engineering work will bring about
          in the maritime interests of the world
          the following . table of distances,
          which are but a few of the many that
          can be worked out, afford a striking
          instance, and not only in a commer
          cial way, but as a means of safecy
          to this nation in time of war will the
          canal be of incalculable value. No
          more will it be necessary to send
          war ships around the southern end
          of South America at great risk, as
          was the case with the Oregon during
          AT WORK ON PANAMA CANAL
          the Spanish war, when in less than
          one-third of the time a whole flotilla
          could be safely and quickly sent
          through the canal, thus practically
          doubling the efficiency and fighting
          strength of our navy.

          D. Higbee has secured all the surveys
          and elevations of the route and built
          in bas-relief 500 perfect reproductions
          of the canal and its surroundings
          from shore to shore. The model Is
          10 feet long and 4' feet wide, cast
          In one piece, showing each mount
          ain, canon, river, town and feature
          of the entire route all drawn to scale
          and handsomely finished in hand
          painting The whole is mounted in a
          frame, so that it can be exhibited in
          any place. This model has great sci
